Amazing staff and great room with a great theme/aesthetic. The location of this hotel was also amazing and everything thatâ€™s needed is walking distance. Would definitely return and stay here again on my next trip.
My second stay at this hotel. It has reasonable prices and great service and is close to highly rated restaurants and shopping. Restaurant in the hotel has a wonderful bar for the evening with an interesting cocktail menu.
Picked the Talbott because it had just been renovated and it's in nice location. The rooms were fine, pretty basic, nothing extraordinary. It seemed that the rest of the hotel didn't get the same makeover as the rooms - carpets in halls seemed old, walls were scuffed. One of two elevators was out during the weekend portion of our stay. Not convenient when your room is on the 15th floor. So we got a pretty good look at the stairwells. The hotel wasn't overly noisy, but you could hear everything from voices to doors slamming. Walls are thin.
Worst WiFi EVER, i have had better WiFi in the middle of the everglades! WiFi reception was horrible anywhere in the hotel, including lobby. WiFi connection takes minutes, but most times it didn't connect at all. If it did connect, then it disconnected randomly. Speeds varied from 0.1 to 3.6 mb/s.
I had a terrible expierence at this hotel. We arrived at 9:30 pm and it took 30 minutes for us to check into the hotel. There were 2 guests in front of us and one was waiting for parking validation. The staff was incredibly slow. We wanted to go to dinner at the hotel, but the empty restaurant had an hour wait at 10 pm. We learned in the end was a blessing because the food was horrible and extremely expensive. Instead we asked the front desk for a reccomendation and he could not really help us. I found the staff the entire trip to be extremely unhelpful.
