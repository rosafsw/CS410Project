Courtyard Chicago Midway Airport,"We spent a quick night here with the family before flying out of Midway for a week.  Beats having to get up super early and drive 2 1/2 hours for a flight!  Very nice lobby and room.  Shuttle bus to airport was quick and driver friendly.,I stayed here 3 nights while in town for business. The room was very clean and comfortable. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I even got a little “washcloth animal” from housekeeping one day. I ate at the Bistro for breakfast twice and the classic oatmeal and coconut milk latte were delicious! Usually I like to eat at the Bistro in the evenings sometimes to but since this hotel is connected to a TGI Friday’s the Bistro is not open in the evening. I never saw anyone using the pool but it looked nice and the gym was small but I was the only one in there after work so it served its purpose. There is of course airplane noise but so close to the airport that’s expected and it didn’t bother me. I’d definitely stay here again! ,We booked a room here because we had an early flight the next morning.

The Congress Plaza Hotel and Convention Center,"Thank you for choosing The Congress Plaza Hotel, we are delighted to hear your visit to Chicago was nothing short from exceptional. We look forward to hosting you for a future stay!,We just went on a road trip and stayed in everything from B&B to country motel, aiming to spend below $125 night. (Congress, being in the city, cost a little more than that, but not much thanks to bargain-hunting website.) ,The Congress ranked third out of the six accommodations. The Congress was a truly old-world hotel with separate bell hops, valets, and even a dedicated person to store luggage as needed. The lobby and public areas were meant to impress.  When we went up to our room in the fourteenth floor, the elegance was still apparent, but the hallways and stairs had layers of paint. In other words, good bones in need of better makeup.  In contrast,  the room was modernized, with comfortable big beds and enough plugs. There was room to walk around furniture, which we later came to appreciate.  The bath was clean and not cramped (though the water pressure was very low.)  There were enough clean towels of an acceptable softness. In general, it was an experience to stay in this hotel of yesteryear, imagining swishing bustles and men in morning coats.,PS In-hotel parking was very expensive... we used Spot Hero to find  a lot for $35 for two days,Thank you for your feedback, we sincerely apologize for the inconveniences encountered during your stay at The Congress Plaza Hotel, we look forward to the opportunity to host you for a future stay!,Fantastic location, close to all the attractions and places to visit, the On-off bus stops at this street and there is no need for a car .  Close to restaurants and food places , all within walking distance . Hotel is old, but service is great ( although we only required service at check in) . The room is comfortable and clean and tidy and feels safe. The beds are comfortable and outside noise (traffic) is minimal, The worst points are the low water pressure in the shower, the thin walls, you can hear the next room if they are rowdy. No fridge or ammenities  to make Tea, only a coffee pot with styrophome cups, it would be an advantage to at least have ceramic/china cups. Water bottles in room at $4 per small bottle, most other hotels offer at least the 1st bottle complimentary. Towels are thin and small and nowhere to hang and dry to reuse. Pillows could be replaced too as some were very lumpy, others were flat and like cardboard.,Overall an economical place to stay close to all Chicago has to offer !,Thank you for your feedback, we sincerely apologize for the inconveniences encountered during your stay at The Congress Plaza Hotel, we look forward to the opportunity to host you for a future stay!,I have stayed at the Congress Hotel for both business and pleasure.  The location is great for both and within walking distance to everything.  I love the fact that it is older and whenever I stay, feel like I have gone back in time to a very romantic era.  The view of the lake is spectacular!!,Thank you for choosing The Congress Plaza Hotel, we are delighted to hear your visit to Chicago was nothing short from exceptional. We look forward to hosting you for a future stay!,The hotel has character, that's for sure. Older hotel, the rooms have been updated as much as they can but you can see and feel the age as you walk through the halls and ride the elevators. Clean, good staff comfortable beds, good water and lots of history. ,The location is perfect. Just watch out for the ghosts. ,Pricing varies depending on local activities. Decent value.,Thank you for choosing The Congress Plaza Hotel, we appreciate your feedback and look forward to hosting you for a future stay!,The location is great. The building's bones are pretty good. But, the management is awful and the customer service couldn't be worse.,The 1/5 review I leave is largely for them sending their housekeeping to knock early morning on all checkout rooms and scream ""housekeeping"" as they slid the bill under the door. After an exhausting three-day conference, I needed by rest, and this was an inexcusable act.,Being old-school, the building has either heat or a/c but not both simultaneously. We were met with a/c in the final days of September, which is ridiculous for Chicago, and were super cold and uncomfortable. The blankets were summer weight, which gave us nothing to stay warm. The window wouldn't open.,The a/c unity had a lot of water in it- think a bowl full of water sitting there in sight. And, probably because of that, my lungs got bothered. I assume it was mold or some bacteria. I don't feel well now.,The shower leaked onto the very cold bathroom tile floor. We called for repair and nothing happened. Later we were told that it is just like that.,The housekeeping was sketchy- not the common soft and kind vibe you'd get from a decent property.,The front desk was understaffed- often just 1 or 2 people for a 1000 room hotel (is it?).,The attendant in the entrance blew a super loud whistle at drivers that stopped too long, causing discomfort for all of us standing there awaiting a ride.,The elevators didn't work well. We'd hear them go right past our floor without opening. We'd often need to walk through a maze of hallways to get to an elevator bank that was properly operational.,The pillows sucked- and smelled.,My friends in other rooms had other complaints, including hearing tv and kids through the thin walls.,Finally, on my way out, someone mentioned to me about how this hotel is infamous for the union-busting management and a decade-long strike. I am not pro-union, I could see that the management clearly is irresponsible and uncaring to guests and workers alike.,Thank you for your feedback. I was very disappointed to read your experience during your stay with us. This level of service is certainly not acceptable and will be addressed with the concerned party. We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences encountered during your stay at The Congress Plaza Hotel.",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d87595-r528779497-The_Congress_Plaza_Hotel_and_Convention_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html>

The Peninsula Chicago,"Dear kmiller8472018,,Thank you for visiting The Peninsula Chicago and for taking the time to share your review.

We appreciate your feedback as it helps us to improve, and we hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back again soon.,Warm regards,,Max Schroeder,Resident Manager,Had 3 nights here. Fantastic location near all the shops and 20mins walk to the “bean”.  ,Service here is exceptional.

Top quality property.   ,Dear Lyle,,Thank you for visiting The Peninsula Chicago and for sharing your review. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay and we truly appreciate your kind comments on our guestrooms, location and service.,We look forward to welcoming you back soon!,Warm regards,,Max Schroeder,Resident Manager,We stayed there for a mini stay cation and everything was excellent. The pool was beautiful and the fitness center clean and polished! Afternoon tea is a must if you are visiting Chicago and staying here because they have the best mini deserts and the best mini sandwiches.,Dear BlerimALB,,Thank you for choosing The Peninsula Chicago for your ""mini staycation"" and for posting your thoughtful review.  We are glad you enjoyed the facilities at The Spa, and that you were able to experience Afternoon Tea in The Lobby during your stay.,We hope for the opportunity to welcome you back soon!,Warm regards,,Max Schroeder,Resident Manager,Beautiful Hotel. Rooms were very spacious I loved the automation of everything through the provided ipads. Not many downtown hotels have a pool as big and nice as the Peninsula's. I recommend this hotel highly. When I walk in I Feel like Royalty!,Dear JackieG29,,Thank you for choosing The Peninsula Chicago and for leaving your kind remarks.  We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the rooms as well as the pool.,We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future!,Kind regards,,Max Schroeder,Resident Manager,First, yes I am aware that The Peninsula Chicago has already received a high trip advisor rating this year. However, I’m a bit of a skeptic and don’t believe everything you see on the internet. A little background...I have been traveling all over the world on business to high end hotels for over 20 years and frankly I have...let’s just say slightly over the expectations. I’m a customer experience expert and I find room for improvement in just about every single consumer interaction. It’s a profession and hobby that I a passionate about. So, fair warning to The Peninsula Chicago, here it comes. Well done, PERFECT!!! You set a new bar for excellence from the moment a reservation is booked, the arrival, bell staff, front desk, food service (regardless of time of day or night), room presentation, anticipation of guest needs (or nice to have enhancements), management (who I had an opportunity to speak with), house keeping, and every step during and after our stay. If anyone is ever on the fence about pulling the trigger, just do it. There is nothing close to their service level in Chicago and certainly a top hotel worthy of some U.S. and world class recognition!,Dear Tminden,,Thank you for visiting The Peninsula Chicago and for sharing your kind review. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay and we truly appreciate your kind comments about our guestrooms, food, service and staff. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back soon!,Kind regards,,Max Schroeder,Resident Manager,Mid-week winter visit as part of a large travelling party. Beautifully appointed property. Well located along the Miracle Mile (and across the street from a Giordano’s ).,Rooms were fitted out as you would expect at a Peninsula...with more techie goo-gas than I’ve ever seen in a hotel room. Took a while to figure out what all the touch-pads were for actually, but everything worked well once I figured out what was what.,Staff was particularly friendly and helpful.,Dear Brian,,Thank you for visiting The Peninsula Chicago and for sharing your kind review. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed the location, guestroom amenities and technology and the friendly staff. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you and your family back soon!,Kind regards,,Max Schroeder,Resident Manager",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d225105-r566532481-The_Peninsula_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html>
The Buckingham Club,"Hey dkonto543994, thanks for the review!  We certainly understand our facility can get a little confusing in terms of location and navigation, it's something we're actively working on and hope to have some of those changes implemented soon!  Also in the works... updates to the rooms!  We've been making some minor improvements and will continue to do so, please come stay with us again in the future and check it out, we promise you won't be disappointed! ,Really, really, really friendly staff, excellent views of city, a bit confusing parking, great value, quick continental breakfast included in room rate. Did not get to try athletic club, though have heard tremendously positive things about it. Hotel near much of downtown attractions! Will be going back for sure!,We're so happy to have had you! Thanks for staying with us and we hope you'll visit again soon.,Overall the stay was disappointing. Stayed at the hotel over the weekend, the main selling feature of the hotel was the access to the beautiful gym facilities - these were only open between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm on weekends which aren't conducive to business travelers needing to use the facilities before work or for leisure travelers looking to get an early start. The rooms were also incredibly dark even with ALL the lights on! ,Hello,,We're sorry to hear you were disappointed with your stay at The Buckingham Hotel, we strive to make each of our guests experience memorable in the most positive of ways.  Though we share a name, the Buckingham.AC fitness facility is a separate entity from the Hotel, and in such they make their own hours.   Please accept our apologies that you weren't able to take full advantage of the facilities.,I will never get tired of staying in this secret hotel! This visit our room was facing the lake, last visit the room was directly across from the Willis Tower!  The gym/spa is phenomenal and the third floor eatery as well as cocktail bar are fantastic and so convenient.

We hope we'll always stay your favorite!,This place is amazing. I have stayed at many hotels, but this one blew us away. It isn't the typical hotel. Only 21 rooms, but wonderfully appointed rooms with a view of Chicago. All the rooms are on the 40th floor.,We think you're amazing too, Alan.  Thanks for taking the time to write us a note!,I have stayed at the Buckingham Club several times over the past several years.  On weekends you can often get a room for $200 or less.  On my recent Presidents Day weekend trip it was under $150 a night.,There are only about 20 rooms here, all ringing the 40th floor of the newer of the Chicago Board of Trade buildings.  Check in is a bit unusual as you enter the office building and check in at a small desk in the lobby.  You are then given two keys, one that allows entrance into the building and elevator, and a second that is a traditional room key.,You have to take two elevators to get to your room, which is a very minor inconvenience.,Rooms themselves are very nice with amazing Chicago views.  While rooms on the North and East sides face the city, we actually like the south facing rooms with views of the lake, river, train stations, and aircraft landing and arriving at Midway.,Location is convenient to Union Station, CTA, and loop attractions like the Willis Tower.  It is a bit far from some of the traditional tourist spots in Grant Park or the Magnificent Mile.  Also, while the neighborhood is vibrant during the business day, there are not many restaurants nearby that are open during the nights or on weekends.,Good Day,,Thank you for such a well-written and thorough review.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Chicago - Lake Shore,"Thank you for writing a review. Many of our guests stay with us because of the proximity of hospitals. We know what a trying time that can be. Best wishes to ""he,"" for a speedy and successful recovery. You are in our thoughts.,We traveled to Chicago to visit with my hubby's mother who was also celebrating her 80th birthday (God is Good).  We decided on this hotel because we had never stayed in Hyde Park when we lived in Waukegan so we gave it a shot.

We're glad to know you enjoyed your stay with us. Best wishes to the pit bull. Please pass on our Happy birthday to mom!

The breakfast needs a little work but overall it was enjoyable.,Thank you for writing a review. Hyde Park is a neighborhood in Chicago, but it is uniquely different from the rest of the city. The breakfast is about to get an overhaul, with several additions.  We're glad you enjoyed your stay.

Coming soon, more breakfast options. We appreciate your business, and we look forward to hosting you again.,It was a great place to stay with a lot of fun things to do around the hotel. Room was gorgeous and would stay there again in a heart beat. Everyone should stay here and it’s only a 8 min drive to the city so you can’t go wrong,Thanks for writing a review. We're not sure about the ""8 min drive"", at least we can't guarantee that, but we're happy to know that everything worked out for you. We look forward to seeing you again.,It’s not a spectacular place, but comfortable enough. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Close to MSI and Hyde Park, covered parking available. Pets allowed as can hear them in hallway, but not in the rooms and no odors. ,Thanks for writing a review. Your kind comments were shared with our staff.

Cambria Hotel & Suites Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Great hotel very well located. Really modern and clean rooms. Everything you need. No fancy lobby making the rate affordable. Nice bar / lunch area. The lobby is located on the 9th floor. Same price hotels I compared with were beat down places. This one is like brand new. Next door to dozens of restaurant and the Chicago River if you like to walk around.,This was our first time in Chicago, and this hotel was perfectly located.  Easy walk to the Oriental Theatre, as it is right next door.  Easy walk to Millenium Park.  Easy walk to The Art Institute.  Easy Uber to Willis Tower and Navy Pier.  The beds were comfy.  The room was quiet.  The only thing to not like about this hotel is the price of valet parking.  It is $67.00 a night.  But, it is 4 star service.  They whisk your car away.  Give you a ticket, and when you are ready to leave, you just text the number on the voucher that they give you and they park your car right in front of the hotel for you.  I would stay here again if driving to Chicago and seeing a show.,Wow! I can't say enough good about this hotel.  The rooms are amazing and modern, street noise completely blocked.  And when we had a minor issue with housekeeping Alec, the supervisor went above and beyond.  Not only got us fresh towels but walked us to our room carrying them for us! He was super accommodating and recommended some amazing adventures for us.  We had such a nice stay we are already planning to come back.  Albeit, I hope Alec has been promoted by then because this guy is what you hope every hotel supervisor is like! ,This Hotel was very clean, and an amazing walking distance from anywhere you wanted to go. Staff was amazing, great housekeeping and very helpful front desk, especially Alec. He gave us amazing restaurant recommendations and booked my mom a massage. The breakfast was delicious as well. I would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion. We personally ubered everywhere we went, so I don’t have much knowledge about parking, but the hotel itself was amazing. I definitely want to come back.,Heather,Thank you for staying with us at the Cambria Chicago Loop Theatre District!  We are glad you had such an amazing time at our location.  We are very pleased Alec was able to help you so much with everything!  We hope to see you again in the near future.,Conveniently located in theater district. Comfortable rooms. ,Terrible valet service. Even when we text to request car 40 minutes ahead we still didn't get our car. ,Being late put a sour taste on the entire stay and the staff didn't really seem to care ,So stay here but park elsewhere ,Hi Lorraine,We are sorry to hear that you had terrible valet service and that the staff didn't seem to care.  Your feedback is very important to us and we will use this to make sure we improve this experience for all of our guest.

The bed is comfy and there is a very nice shower with a nice rain shower head. ,The staff at the reception was very friendly, welcoming and professional. We had diner in the hotel restaurant (cochon volant) and that was ok, The cocktails at the bar were very nice and there was an upbeat atmosphere (it was on a Friday night). There is a section on the 3rd or 4th floor with snack, coffee (not great) and drinks and some space to rest and work.,Thank you so much for sharing your feedback with us. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and room accommodations. We hope to have you as a guest again soon!,After visiting 4 different cities in the US we were very happy to be greeted by the Hyatt Centric Loop King room. Lots of space, huge comfy bed and fantastic shower. The staff are friendly and the hotel is very clean, decor is understated but impeccably detailed. It’s cool without being too try hard trendy.,The gym is good and the Corner on level 3 where guests can relax out of their room is a nice touch, it supplies complimentary teas, coffee, newspapers and snacks. ,Just to be aware, the deposit they take at $75 per night is surprisingly steep compared to most other hotels but it is refunded. ,Thank you so much for sharing your feedback with us. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and room accommodations. We hope to have you as a guest again soon!,Very nice modern hotel. Bed was very comfortable. Appreciated the Kerig and refrigerator in the room. The “corner” coffee/snack area was very nice.

We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and room accommodations. We hope to have you as a guest again soon!,It's always tricky picking out a hotel in a city you've never been and it almost becomes a gamble. But this time I chose well and I absolutely loved the hotel and its location. ,It was right for us, as we wanted to be in walking distance of the places we wanted to visit. Also a convenient hotel to find if you're using the subway. Reception was friendly and always helpful.,Our room was gorgeous and the bathroom was just the right size. Soft beds, and there's a mini fridge for those leftover take-aways from around the city. ,Thank you so much for sharing your feedback with us.

Hotel Versey - Days Inn Chicago,"Hi 661Katie,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you appreciated our hotel's convenient location.,We would love to welcome you back to our hotel again soon.,Thanks again. ,A really fun hotel in a lot of ways, especially the decor in the entrance hallway, elevator festooned with humorous bumper stickers, a lot of homage to the hotel's former days hosting famous rock bands. Fabulous location, almost everything you could need nearby. About 15 mins walk to DePaul if your business is taking you there as mine was. Single rooms small with king bed dominating, but very comfortable bedding and pillows. Excellent big screen TV. Bathroom small but fine, everything seemed very clean. Showerhead comes out at weird angle from side wall rather than end of the tub, but chalked that up to the ""quirky"" side of the hotel. The one big drawback is that the walls are VERY thin. I heard every word of my neighbor's phone conversation pretty clearly, and as I was checking out superearly 4:30 AM, heard more than that from across the hall if you know what I mean. The heat/AC unit is pretty loud, but can serve as effective white noise to help the situation, and the hotel provides decent earplugs daily on your nightstand, as I imagine they are well aware of this situation. But for a business traveler, or young travelers looking for a quality but not too expensive hotel in great Chicago location, this fits the bill very well. I really enjoyed my stay overall and would come back.,Hi sprulyph,  ,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.  ,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you appreciated our hotel's convenient location in the heart of Chicago's Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.  ,We would love to welcome you back to our hotel again in the future.  ,Thanks again.,This was a very family friendly hotel for my kids and me.  There are some nifty art pieces in the foyer and lounge.  The elevator is tastefully decorated with bumper stickers.,The mattresses were a bit stiff for my taste, giving me a back ache.  But the rooms were clean and spacious.  There were no refrigerators nor microwaves in the rooms.  There was no pool on site.  The parking was $40/day plus tips for the valets, but the valet service was very quick and courteous.  The rooms were very quiet.,I enjoyed the location.  It was a very quick and easy drive from the hotel to the Museum Campus housing the Shedd Aquarium, the Adler Planetarium, and the Field Museum.  There were convenience stores at the end of the block for quick snacks and sandwiches.  The traffic was not bad at all.,Hi Candy,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you appreciated our hotel's convenient location in the heart of Chicago's Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.,We would love to welcome you back to our hotel again in the future.,Thanks again.,The hotel has a great lication for us - lincoln park. The common areas were funky in a food way. The guest room was underwhelming and in need of updating. Hotel staff was exceptional ,Hi Bikkie913,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you appreciated our hotel's convenient location in the heart of Chicago's Lincoln Park and Lakeview neighborhoods.,We would love to welcome you back again soon.,Thanks again. ,The hotel was clean and comfortable with two notable exceptions.  First, parking is VERY inconvenient because you MUST use valet parking or walk a 1/4 mile to the unsecured public lot.  Second, the water pressure in the old building is so low that a shower is much less than satisfactory.,Hi ghobbs2018,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you found our hotel to be clean and comfortable.,There are a variety of parking options in the area - we recommend using the SpotHero app as another option.,We hope that you would consider returning to our hotel again in the future.,Thanks again.

The Buckingham Club,"Hello,,We're sorry to hear you were disappointed with your stay at The Buckingham Hotel, we strive to make each of our guests experience memorable in the most positive of ways.  Though we share a name, the Buckingham.AC fitness facility is a separate entity from the Hotel, and in such they make their own hours.   Please accept our apologies that you weren't able to take full advantage of the facilities.,I will never get tired of staying in this secret hotel! This visit our room was facing the lake, last visit the room was directly across from the Willis Tower!  The gym/spa is phenomenal and the third floor eatery as well as cocktail bar are fantastic and so convenient.  Set directly above the CBOE - it’s perfect for our needs and wants!,Well thanks Heather, we're so happy to hear that you've enjoyed your time with us!  We hope we'll always stay your favorite!,This place is amazing. I have stayed at many hotels, but this one blew us away. It isn't the typical hotel. Only 21 rooms, but wonderfully appointed rooms with a view of Chicago. All the rooms are on the 40th floor.,We think you're amazing too, Alan.  Thanks for taking the time to write us a note!,I have stayed at the Buckingham Club several times over the past several years.  On weekends you can often get a room for $200 or less.  On my recent Presidents Day weekend trip it was under $150 a night.,There are only about 20 rooms here, all ringing the 40th floor of the newer of the Chicago Board of Trade buildings.  Check in is a bit unusual as you enter the office building and check in at a small desk in the lobby.  You are then given two keys, one that allows entrance into the building and elevator, and a second that is a traditional room key.,You have to take two elevators to get to your room, which is a very minor inconvenience.,Rooms themselves are very nice with amazing Chicago views.  While rooms on the North and East sides face the city, we actually like the south facing rooms with views of the lake, river, train stations, and aircraft landing and arriving at Midway.,Location is convenient to Union Station, CTA, and loop attractions like the Willis Tower.  It is a bit far from some of the traditional tourist spots in Grant Park or the Magnificent Mile.  Also, while the neighborhood is vibrant during the business day, there are not many restaurants nearby that are open during the nights or on weekends.,Good Day,,Thank you for such a well-written and thorough review.  You covered everything from location to rooms to the views, we really appreciate feedback like this!  We look forward to having you in one of our south facing rooms in the future! ,If you are looking for friendliness at the front desk, a spotless clean room, and more privacy than your own home. Look no further the Buckingham Club is a terrific hotel and I will definitely continue staying here when staying in Chicago ,What a fantastic review!  Thank you kindly for the nice words about the staff and our rooms, you're always a welcome guest with us!,Can’t fault the room, and such fabulous views. Bed very comfortable. Decor is getting on a bit, but it’s fine. Sometimes the room cleaning was a bit half-hearted, but everything was clean.,It’s just a bit strange - it doesn’t feel like a hotel as the reception is in the lobby area of a big office block, and to get to the restaurant (and gym), you had to descend 40 floors, walk around to another set of lifts and go up 3. I didn’t bother with the restaurant - which is shut st weekends. They do provide some rather nasty pastries for weekend breakfast in a small ‘club’ room on the same floor as the rooms.,It is worth it for the views, though I don’t joke if I’ll stay again. Really convenient for the blue line from the airport and the loop.,Hello MuddyBath,,Nice to hear from you!  We appreciate and totally understand your feedback- we are an unusual hotel, and we do have Great Views, and we're happy you stayed with us!  We're working on some improvements to the weekend breakfast spread, and in the near future hope to implement some upgrades to the rooms.  Perhaps you will give us another chance the next time you're in town.,Cheers!",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d498305-r566542190-The_Buckingham_Club-Chicago_Illinois.html>

We hope that you will come back and see us again very soon!,Have a wonderful day!,Ryan Nicholson,Assistant Front Office Manager,Nice hotel BUT the rooms could be cleaned better. A lot of cracks in the ceilings which is a little scary. Also one of the times we used valet the man made us take our car and park it ourself which was his job.

Sheraton Grand Chicago,"If you are just looking for a place to sleep....this place is fine, I suppose.  The location just off Michigan Avenue/Mag mile is 'fine'.,When I approached the front desk as a Platinum member, 9 people were lined up to the SPG carpet, as all 3 agents were working from the 'preferred' check in locations.  ALL 8 stations to the right....were empty.  NO STATUS recognition here for check in....everyone gets the same.  First impression was not good.,The lobby is spacious and large, but dated with regard to finish and design.,My room, on the Club floor was also dated, and everywhere I walked through this hotel seemed to scream '1992 wants their decor back'.  Dated.,My room was clean.  Pillows were old and tired.  Room was BORING, BLAND, VANILLA, and nothing special at all.  TIRED.  Same with bathroom.,Dont get me going on the Club Lounge.  This Club had minimal offerings that were over promised to the masses on my weekend stay.  Where else have I waited in line in a Club behind 23 people to get a bagel and yogurt on the morning?  Overrun with kids and families ...this outlet seems to be given to everyone.  Someone on the elevator watching 2 gentleman walking in with HUGE PLATES OF FOOD commented ""We must be the only people in the hotel without Club access for free breakfast'.  I replied:  ""Be thankful.  You aren't missing a thing"".  I would never use that Club again.   Gross.,Platinum status means nothing in this hotel.  Nothing.  ,I doubt that i would ever select this hotel again, either.  Chicago is flooded with better offerings at the same price point.  MUCH BETTER OFFERINGS with better service, much better rooms, and better 'extra's.  No reason to return here at all.,Hello JamesE339,Thank you for taking time to share feedback regarding your recent visit with us. As an Elite SPG member it is always our intention to ensure a welcome and comfortable arrival experience and stay and it seems we really fell short. I would like to offer my sincerest apologies for the challenges you faced during this visit as this surely is not indicitive of the level of service we strive to provide. I have shared your information with the correct departments to ensure all comments are addressed in a productive way.,I do hope we are able to welcome you back and rectify this experience. If so, please reach out to me directly so I can ensure your visit is without hiccup.,Kind regards,,Eric B.,Front Desk Manager,We were so excited to find good rates for this weekend in Chicago that we planned a last minute trip here with our teen daughters. We chose the Sheraton Grand because of its location and were anticipating a great stay. What we got was much less. Dated rooms and dirty bed blankets and very slow customer service. Dirty showers in the gym area that even after my husband pointed it out for three straight days never got touched. Great location right on the river though! I’ve been in customer service my entire life - this place either needs to find better efficiency or bulk up their staff. I am giving three stars because they did try to rectify the dirty blanket issue AND we originally got a good deal when we booked - so I can’t expect gold trimmings and red carpets, I suppose....,Hello Sheepish02,,Thank you for taking the time to post about your recent experience. I apologize that your recent stay fell short of your expectations. It is our goal to make sure that our guests are able to feel comfortable and relaxed during their stay, and this did not happen with your visit. We are following up with the appropriate team to ensure that we correct moving forward. Again, thank you for your feedback and we hope to host you in the future. ,This is a business oriented hotel with good meeting rooms, etc.  We were on a spring break trip with a 10 year old.  The hotel rooms and service were very good, the pool and other facilites good as well.  The location of around a mile or so from many attactions is good as well, as Taxi service was excellent.,The only draw-back with this hotel is with the dining.  While the cafe's were nice, they all closed at 2:00pm and were not open for dinner.  The only on property option was a Shulas.  Not a good place for kids or any casual dining.  That might be OK, but there are no casual restaurants less than a mile away.  Fortunately, the room service was excellent and ( for a change) priced right.,I can honestly say I'll never stay in another Sheraton anywhere in the world. The rooms are barely held together. The plumbing in my room is poor, faucets falling out of the wall, toilets that don't flush. The pool area and amenities are completely disastrous and inadequate. The pool floor is lifting, there's no hot water in the showers, there's no body wash, swim suit bags etc. There are absolutely NO modern amenities. For goodness sake the safe has a KEY!!! In today's world that's an utter joke. Your room isn't cleaned or tidied, and even when you complain it's still not done right. It's not a true hotel service or experience. Honestly Airbnb is a better option. I'll be recommending to conference organisers to shift hotels if this is the standard one can expect. But best of all I just read a manager response to another patron which said they strive for excellent service... Yet a complaint in person doesn't get any contact from a manager. I'm not sure what kind of customer experience Sheraton are striving for but it's certainly not a good one.,Dear Nikki F, ,Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding your stay with us. It sounds like we missed several opportunities and we are very disappointed, as you rightly were. This is not our standard, and not what our typical guest experiences. We apologize that we did not live up to our hotel’s name and that we were not at our best. We would love for you to reach out to us the next time you are in the area to give us a second chance. Thanks again for your feedback-it is valuable to our team and we will strive to do better.,Andy Markus,Hotel Manager,Wanting to surprise my husband with a trip to see a taping of NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me for his birthday, I booked a club level room at the downtown Sheraton Grand.  This was actually my second time staying at this hotel (the first was during a conference several years ago).  My first experience at this hotel was OK...main problem had to do with the slamming of room doors around my room during my stay.  I didn't blame the other guests, the challenge was that the room doors were heavy and slammed whenever anyone left their rooms.,For this visit, I did some research on the different club level hotel lounges in Chicago and the Sheraton Grand's lounge was ranked highly (it has two floors).  As a result, I booked three nights at the hotel.  We checked in after our flight and were given a room on the 33rd floor (down the hall from the lounge).  The room was ok...just not the best view.  The lounge itself was nice and the staff was outstanding!!!  The only challenge was that the hotel clearly rented too many club lounge level rooms during our visit (I think it was Spring Break week for Chicago).  In the morning and evenings, the lounge was simply overwhelmed by the number of people using it.   The staff did a heroic job of trying to keep up but it was definitely a challenge.  With the amount of people in the room, it clearly was not the ""oasis"" that many lounges advertise.  ,The only other challenge was that the hotel pool and steam rooms were shut down for renovation.  While it is understandable that renovations and upgrades need to be made, it would have been nice to have been informed prior to our arrival that these amenities would not be available.,After my second stay, I think it was clear to me that the hotel would be great for a conference but not necessarily for a vacation or weekend away.,Dear pnwguy1j, ,Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding your stay with us and we are very sorry for not meeting your expectations during your visit. It sounds like we missed several opportunities to make your stay great and we understand your disappointment. This is not our standard, and not what our typical guest experiences.

Sheraton Grand Chicago,"Dear Jennifer,,Thanks for including the Sheraton Grand Chicago in your travel plans.

We're delighted that our location was ideal for your sightseeing excursions around Chicago and that you were pleased with our service and amenities and utilized our convenient luggage storage service. We enjoyed hosting you and your family and look forward to seeing you again in the upcoming months. ,Andy Markus,Hotel Manager,Our family of 7 decided to head into Chicago for an evening to see the Christmas lights, and found a great rate at the Sheraton Grand Chicago!  Beautiful hotel, right along the river!  Indoor pool for kids/teenagers, as well as a Starbucks.  Quick fast check in, and elevators always available!  Plan on spending quite a bit for parking, but otherwise, a great hotel if you want to spend the weekend exploring downtown Chicago!,As a Starwood preferred member, I received a room on the 33rd club floor, with access to lounge hors d'vours and continental breakfast.  Coffee, water, pop, tea.  It's the little things that make your business feel appreciated.  I received in an room fridge for free for all my snacks I brought in my cooler, and I received early check in and late check out to accomadate my late night fireworks show at Navy Pier, only one mile away. The view from my room was beautiful.  The hotel was clean and new.  I didn't use the gym, but I wanted to mention that I would stay here again because I want to use the beautiful equipment.,Make sure you ask for your uber to pick you up from Shula's, look at your map carefully.,I can be a very picky sleeper and I was very comfortable in their beds!!,Some complaints:  They were 2 independent brawls that broke out in my hallway, and security was paged to remove the guests.  This isn't really the hotels fault. They had door men, and were checking key guards.  Just mentioning the things that were going on in the area.,WAY TOO MANY KIDS to enjoy the beautiful pool. Literally piercing screams filled my ear drums the second I walked in. I don't mean like 5 kids, I mean like 30, it was like chuck E. Cheese in there.  Not relaxing!,Dear Carla J,,Thank you for taking the time to post your nice review of the Sheraton Grand Chicago. We are glad to know you had a comfortable time in your room. However, we are sorry you were inconvenienced by any means while being here. Thanks again for your loyalty towards our brand, and we hope to welcome you again soon.,Andy Markus,Hotel Manager,Teidra B. worked hard at the front desk to make everything perfect for our stay.  It isn't easy, in a busy city, to find a desk clerk who is interested in making every detail perfect.  While I was registering, an upset guest interrupted us in a rude manner, and I was impressed with the professionalism and tack with which Teidra handled the situation.  ,The rooms are conveniently furnished, and clean with well trained cleaning staff.  The location is an easy walk to Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue.  This has become my new favorite Chicago Hotel.  ,The location of the Sheraton offers one of the best views up the river, in Chicago.,Thank you to Maria for choosing a nice floor for us and being a humble and kind crew, Our room is clean ♥️ We’re so comfortable but there’s something wrong in the heater it’s cold and the foods is so expensive but worth it ,Dear Mialene,,Thank you for the 5-Star rating! We really appreciate seeing how much our staff member Maria exceeded your expectations and how much you enjoyed your clean, comfortable room.  We are sorry for any issues with your HVAC unit in your room and will address this with our maintenance team. Thank you for choosing to stay with us, we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for a future stay. ,Andy Markus,Hotel Manager,First time in Chicago and glad we chose this hotel for our 4 night stay. We had a nice experience all around. The doormen were very attentive and welcoming every time we came by. Check in was quick and Heidi was very professional and remembered our name if we came back for questions during our stay. We got a high floor room facing the river, which was a nice view. A special recognition to the club lounge associates Connie and Rene.. they are a huge asset to the company! They were attentive, had a nice sense of humor, and super friendly and helpful! One night we ordered warm milk for our baby and room service brought it by... we then noticed later on that it was on the house!",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d87638-r551341920-Sheraton_Grand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Cambria Hotel & Suites Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"This Hotel was very clean, and an amazing walking distance from anywhere you wanted to go. Staff was amazing, great housekeeping and very helpful front desk, especially Alec. He gave us amazing restaurant recommendations and booked my mom a massage. The breakfast was delicious as well.

The hotel is new and feel and look like it has been recently opened. I like the room, not too big and with a cosy feel. Very comfy bed and bed linen, nice TV and easy to access TV Chanel. The WiFi was working well and easy to access (and free).,The bathroom is spacious with a nice big walk in shower, only negative was the available washing product, not great. Went to buy my own at the nearby CVS. They have a restaurant but did not try it. The reception staff were friendly and professional (the lobby and check in counter are on floor 9, not the ground floor). ,The hotel is closed to many place for eating or drinking and very close the many theatre. For me when travelling for business this is a perfect (and affordable) hotel catering for just what I need.,David,Thank you for leaving us such welcoming and amazing feedback.

I could hear some street noise, but was not overly bothersome. ,The king room was small, could accommodate two, was clean and uncluttered. There was a shortage of storage space for clothing and luggage. Property photos are a true depiction of what you should expect.,The bathroom was very spacious and I enjoyed the rainfall shower very much!,Breakfast here is pricey, but very good, and filling. I did not have lunch or dinners here so I cannot comment on those meals.,I have a few complaints: 1) my tv was not working when I checked in and had to ask the front desk for repairs, 2) housekeeping did not replace my tissues when I was clearly out, I had to ask the front desk for a replacement, 3) the bar is a joke. My coworker and I ordered (from the menu) the strawberry fields mixed drink and it was undrinkable. Stick with beer, wine or simple liquors.,Knowing all these things, I would stay here again.,LiliM06,It is great to hear from you on how your stay was.  We are glad you enjoyed yourselves and that you found our hotel's location convenient.  We always loving hear from our guest!

Cambria Hotel & Suites Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"Wow! I can't say enough good about this hotel.  The rooms are amazing and modern, street noise completely blocked.  And when we had a minor issue with housekeeping Alec, the supervisor went above and beyond.  Not only got us fresh towels but walked us to our room carrying them for us! He was super accommodating and recommended some amazing adventures for us.  We had such a nice stay we are already planning to come back.  Albeit, I hope Alec has been promoted by then because this guy is what you hope every hotel supervisor is like! ,This Hotel was very clean, and an amazing walking distance from anywhere you wanted to go. Staff was amazing, great housekeeping and very helpful front desk, especially Alec. He gave us amazing restaurant recommendations and booked my mom a massage. The breakfast was delicious as well. I would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion. We personally ubered everywhere we went, so I don’t have much knowledge about parking, but the hotel itself was amazing. I definitely want to come back.,Heather,Thank you for staying with us at the Cambria Chicago Loop Theatre District!  We are glad you had such an amazing time at our location.  We are very pleased Alec was able to help you so much with everything!  We hope to see you again in the near future.,Conveniently located in theater district. Comfortable rooms. ,Terrible valet service. Even when we text to request car 40 minutes ahead we still didn't get our car. ,Being late put a sour taste on the entire stay and the staff didn't really seem to care ,So stay here but park elsewhere ,Hi Lorraine,We are sorry to hear that you had terrible valet service and that the staff didn't seem to care.  Your feedback is very important to us and we will use this to make sure we improve this experience for all of our guest. We do hope that you will stay with us again so we can show you the quality of service we pride ourselves in having.,Stayed here with my kids for a weekend trip and to see a show at the Chicago theater.  The room was clean, modern and comfortable.  Bluetooth mirror was an added bonus.  Great location to any of the theaters in that area.  Close walk to much of downtown also.  Would like a better offering for quick breakfast food or coffee in the morning in the lobby area.,Thank you for taking the time to complete our TripAdvisor Review.  We are so glad that you loved the location and the Bluetooth mirrors that was in the bathroom.,Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. ,We hope to see you again soon!,I had a nice stay the the Cambria hotel in Chicago. The hotel is new and feel and look like it has been recently opened. I like the room, not too big and with a cosy feel. Very comfy bed and bed linen, nice TV and easy to access TV Chanel. The WiFi was working well and easy to access (and free).,The bathroom is spacious with a nice big walk in shower, only negative was the available washing product, not great. Went to buy my own at the nearby CVS. They have a restaurant but did not try it. The reception staff were friendly and professional (the lobby and check in counter are on floor 9, not the ground floor). ,The hotel is closed to many place for eating or drinking and very close the many theatre. For me when travelling for business this is a perfect (and affordable) hotel catering for just what I need.,David,Thank you for leaving us such welcoming and amazing feedback.  We are very glad you enjoyed the spacious bathroom and our friendly professional staff.

This was the highest hostel listed for my available dates and I immediately booked it for about $30 per night (including an extra $3 per night due to me not being a member of HI USA. I reserved parking at a nearby (5 minute walk away) parking garage (2nd East 8th Street) for $70 for 3 Nights, after reading about how it’s much cheaper if you pay beforehand. When I arrived at the hostel, I was surprised to see how nice it was! This was my first hostel so I was expecting something like my ugly undergraduate university dorm, which it was not like at all! It was like a college dorm, but a really nice one! I thought that I would have to leave my room to access the bathroom, but there was a bathroom in the room. Toilet paper is provided and the shower had a soap dispenser. The room had 6 bunk beds all labeled alphabetically with a corresponding locker (where you have to provide the lock). A towel, pillow, linens and a blanket are all provided. I checked in at 4pm and was surprised to see no one occupying any of the beds/lockers. I was so happy to have the room to myself. When I came back around 9pm that night, I saw that there was another locker occupied and knew that I had a roommate. I met him later that night and we chatted for awhile, which was nice. A few other people came to use the room the following days. There was also free breakfast daily from 7-10am. There was also a large, nice common area on the second floor (where the dining room is also located) with couches, pool tables, a ping pong table and computers where I chilled during the second night there to catch up on some emails.

Hilton Garden Inn Chicago/North Loop,"This Hotel is clean and the staff are first rate.  Its in a very good position for sightseeing and business.  The room was fairly compact but for a City Centre I sort of expected that.  The fittings were very good and the bathroom and shower modern.  However one thing I found really strange.  The wardrobe appeared a good size however when I opened it there was a shelf with the hanger rail and hangers on underneath, but then another shelf 2 feet below again with hanger rail and hangers. 3 feet below that was the safe and the bottom of the wardrobe.  This meant that I could not even hang a shirt never mind a winter coat.  I managed to squeeze a couple of shirts behind the door but most stuff had to stay in the case.  The breakfast was personal order on a slip and the ladies in there were most attentive.,Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago North Loop for the Magnificent Mile lights parade. Front staff as very friendly and helpful throughout the stay. Hotel is newer, room was in impeccable condition, very clean and nice. Great beds and very quiet. Had dinner in The Garden restaurant which had a nice menu and good food. Breakfast was also very good. Will stay hear again next year for sure!,Dear Hilton Garden Inn Managers:,I came into town recently to attend a medical conference held at another hotel nearby on Wacker.  I had a Hilton property room already reserved, but at a hotel far away from the conference.  My supervisor was staying at the Hilton Hampton Inn Chicago/North Loop (next door to the Hilton Garden Inn), much closer to the conference hotel.  Upon visiting the desk, I asked the gracious and accommodating ""Ivelina"" if she could contact my existing Hilton hotel and ask them if they could cancel THAT reservation -- without penalty -- so that I might stay at the HGI Chicago/North Loop.  She did so, to my satisfaction.  (Manager Marcus Allen also assisted her as well.)  The change in hotel plans made for a great logistical trip and business meeting!  Thank you to your Team.  Please recognize them to their peers.  I look forward to returning to your property and kind staff!,Best, ,Scott Brockett,Diamond Member,My sisters & I spent 2 nights here when we went to see Hamilton. Location was very convenient to the theater & bus routes.  The staff were all extremely helpful & friendly.  Room was a bit small but more than adequate for our needs.  I would recommend it!,Nice hotel in a good location. Block from Michigan Ave and just across the river from the shops. Navy Pier and all public transit easy walking distance. Also 15 Starbucks within two blocks. Bar Johnathan is very friendly and knowledgeable about things to do and see ",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d8142668-r542466810-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Chicago_North_Loop-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Hostelling International Chicago,"Thanks for sharing your experience of your recent stay with us. Our team always strives to give the service our guests expect & deserve. I appreciate the comments as we are always looking for ways to improve the hostel & service we give our guests.,Read all the positive reviews on this place & went ahead & booked it for my son & I. Worked great. We had a private room with bunk beds, place was clean, staff were friendly & helpful, safe location, continental breakfast wasn’t great but saved us time & money as we set & ate breakfast & planned the day. Location is great, along with the price for being in the city. Only downside was our room was next to the train, easily sorted with a cheap pair of earplugs. Definitely recommend this place. We saw people of all ages, walks of life so don’t get put off by this being a hostel. ,We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your hostel experience! Thank you for taking the time to highlight some of the parts of our hostel that made your visit so memorable. Our staff is happy to hear that you would return to stay with us again. Please be sure to visit more of our hostels around the world to get further insight into how the world travels. Thanks for taking the time to share your kind words!,We stayed here for four nights. The previos experience with HI Hostel was good however this time we were really disappointed. ,First of all key-cards did not work at all. We ended up to activate the keys three times. When we reached our room, the room was not made up. Supervisor R offered us 50% discount for the first night however each time we asked for the receipt of the refund reception staff have not heard about the discount. In the end they said that they will refund us only 25%. ,The room was very cold. Breakfast room very dirty, floor was sticky the same thing with the tables. Staff at the breakfast area did not care a lot to refill items which were finished. ,Positive things: location, breakfast included. ,Thank you for choosing our hotel for your recent visit to HI Chicago. It was disheartening to read about the issues you encountered during your stay.  We take these concerns seriously and place great emphasis on maintaining a clean and healthy safe environment for all of our guests. Your concerns have been relayed to our leadership team and together we will make sure steps are taken so this doesn't happen again. ,We value your feedback and your business. I would like to let you know we have comped one night for your inconvenience, you should bee a credit on the credit card used for payment. Should  you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call. I hope you will give us a second chance. I will personally see to it that your experience will be memorable. ,Safe Travels, , Ruby Martinez,I booked HI Chicago for three nights after checking out TripAdvisor for hostels. This was the highest hostel listed for my available dates and I immediately booked it for about $30 per night (including an extra $3 per night due to me not being a member of HI USA. I reserved parking at a nearby (5 minute walk away) parking garage (2nd East 8th Street) for $70 for 3 Nights, after reading about how it’s much cheaper if you pay beforehand. When I arrived at the hostel, I was surprised to see how nice it was! This was my first hostel so I was expecting something like my ugly undergraduate university dorm, which it was not like at all! It was like a college dorm, but a really nice one! I thought that I would have to leave my room to access the bathroom, but there was a bathroom in the room. Toilet paper is provided and the shower had a soap dispenser. The room had 6 bunk beds all labeled alphabetically with a corresponding locker (where you have to provide the lock). A towel, pillow, linens and a blanket are all provided. I checked in at 4pm and was surprised to see no one occupying any of the beds/lockers. I was so happy to have the room to myself. When I came back around 9pm that night, I saw that there was another locker occupied and knew that I had a roommate. I met him later that night and we chatted for awhile, which was nice. A few other people came to use the room the following days. There was also free breakfast daily from 7-10am. There was also a large, nice common area on the second floor (where the dining room is also located) with couches, pool tables, a ping pong table and computers where I chilled during the second night there to catch up on some emails. As is expected, there was a lot of young mid-20’s hanging out in the area all doing their own thing. My stay here was fantastic! At first, I was a bit apprehensive of using hostels, but this experience has upended my expectations! I will definitely be using hostels! ,Thank you for choosing to stay at HI Chicago and for sharing your wonderful experience online. We are delighted to read that you loved our convenient location as well as, our comfortable accommodation which was perfect for your needs. Also, we appreciate your comments about our breakfast area. Thank you for being our guest. It was our pleasure hosting you and we hope to welcome you back with us soon.,The location of this hostel is superior--on the Loop, a short walk to main attractions like the Art Institute & Millennium Park. Our King Room-spare, clean and very hot-shared a bathroom with three other rooms.. Staff were great, very helpful for finding free and low-cost activites; discount tickets are for sale at the desk. Common areas were large, with meeting rooms & library available. The travelers were not social like in other hostels, mostly staring into their phones or keeping with their groups.,Thank you for choosing to stay at HI Chicago and for sharing your wonderful experience online.

Crowne Plaza Chicago West Loop,"Dear Dr.,,Thank you kindly for your review and taking the time to share your experience from your stay at the Crowne Plaza West Loop. We're delighted to hear you enjoyed your time as our guest and that Paul transcended all your expectations. We invite you back for  to discover more of what our dynamic West Loop neighborhood has to offer!,Thank you again for your feedback.,Kip Stehling,Hotel General Manager,Crowne Plaza Chicago West Loop,From the far NW suburbs of Chicago, we stayed here for a night to go to a Chicago Blackhawks game down the street, and then were only 20 minutes from Midway the next day when we flew to FL for a cruise (instead of 90 mins from home.) No big complaints about the building or the staff, but there is currently construction going on next door which makes traffic and parking right now next to impossible. I couldn’t even get into the valet section to have them take my vehicle, so we parked down the street. Took a bit of time to find a place to park, and then picking up my family out front was nearly impossible. Hopefully that will change once the skyscraper next door is completed. Unfortunately no pool for the kids (if there is, sorry we missed it, wasn’t advertised.) ,Dear Bruce B,,Thank you for choosing Crowne Plaza West Loop and for taking the time to provide feedback about your experience. I would like to start by apologizing to you for not meeting your expectations. We strive to make each stay as pleasant and exceptional as possible, and we will use your comments to provide a better experience in the future. ,Again, thank you for sharing your comments.,Kip Stehling,Hotel General Manager,Crowne Plaza West Loop,Nothing could have been more perfect.  My daughter and grandchildren were visiting from Virginia and they helped make our stay much more wonderful than we would have expected.

I highly recommend it!!!,Dear Fran,,We are thrilled to learn that you had a perfect experience at our hotel.  Thank you for sharing that we provide great accommodations and food along with  our great service. We appreciate your business and looking forward to welcoming you back when in the area. ,Kip Stehling,Hotel General Manager,Crowne Plaza Chicago West Loop,Hotel was very nice, food from the restaurant was wonderful. Parking and the valet a nightmare but the staff did a great job. Didn’t care to pay $49 for valet that seemed crazy but we did it.  Went to the United Center, easy to get an Uber to get us there and back. Had a great time ,Dear Eagles Concert,,We are thrilled to learn that you had an excellent experience during your recent stay with us. Thank you for sharing your  detailed feedback on our valet services, we do our best to ensure our guests have the best  all around experience and are constantly improving our systems.  We appreciate your business and looking forward to welcoming you back when in the area. ,Kip Stehling,Hotel General Manager,Crowne Plaza Chicago West Loop,I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. My room was spotless. This was the cleanest looking room I have been in a long time. In the room, chase lounge was old and bathroom tile old looking as well but that truly didn't concern me. I am always grateful to have a very clean room. ,The staff from valet (mine was included in room price) and front desk to waiters were all very friendly. No snubbing here!,Breakfast buffet was very good but next trip I would skip the $18 buffet and order the $12 breakfast from menu which is a full plate of eggs, meat and home fries.,This hotel can cost much less than others when booked in advanced. ,I recently stayed downtown on the magnificent mile, but this location is better than being downtown. Grocery, restaurants and shopping nearby. West loop seemed to have so much to offer. Uber cost was a little higher moving around from west loop than from starting downtown (not sure why). ,I will gladly stay at this hotel again. Thank you Crowne Plaza for a clean and friendly stay with such short minute notice.,Dear Julie S.,,We at Crowne Plaza Chicago West Loop appreciate you taking the time to share with us your experience as we are always pleased to receive feedback from our valued guest. We are delighted to know that you rate the overall hotel service, facilities and attitude of the staff highly, and are so glad you enjoyed your stay.They will surely appreciate it. We look forward to seeing you again soon.,Kip Stehling,Hotel General Manager,Crowne Plaza Chicago West Loop,We stayed here for a concert that was at the united center. This place is located in a very convenient location. If you drive, the best option is to use valet which is approximately $50 that gets added to your hotel bill. It is pretty good system because they send you a text with a link to use when you’re ready to get the car out. We were offered free breakfast buffet vouchers because they first gave us a dirty room. The buffet was okay but I’m not sure what it regularly costs and with it being Chicago, I guarantee there’s much better places to eat for what I can expect you’d pay for. Overall, I liked this hotel but I didn’t get a lot of sleep due to a party across the hall that started at 3 am and was still going on when we went down for breakfast at 830. (Props to them - Maybe we should’ve joined them!)The walls are paper thin and not sure I’d stay here again due to that but overall a decent stay. ,Hi Shelby A,,Thank you for your candid review, highlighting not only the bad but also the good points of your stay. We are glad to hear you found our location and valet parking convenient to your needs. I am sorry to learn your stay was negatively impacted by the noise from other guests during your stay. We understand the importance of a good night's sleep and if there is anything we can do to make your next stay more comfortable, please don't hesitate to ask the Front Desk or the Manager on Duty.,Again, many thanks for your feedback. We hope to see you again soon.,Sincerely,,Connie D,Case Manager,IHGService",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d273262-r571367469-Crowne_Plaza_Chicago_West_Loop-Chicago_Illinois.html>

We wanted to stay at a hotel close by the United Center so we came across the Crowne Plaza, once we arrived it was awesome customer service from the valet parking to the time we checked in. Each employee we came across was awesome.  Simeon Cunningham checked us in he was a great front desk person. he explained everything to us and wanted to make sure we had a great time.  room was clean and spacious.........I will be back thanks,In town for a concert at the United Center and wanted a convenient and nice place for the overnight stay. Check-in and valet parking service were friendly and very accommodating. We enjoyed dinner in Greek Town which was only a two bloc walk. The drive to the United Center was an easy one and under 10 minutes. The stay met all our needs as the rooms were clean and service was a ""10"".,Two very good friends of mine were going to the Chicago Bulls game 12/09/17. They needed a hotel to nearby so I suggested the crowne plaza and ask for Simeon who made my stay amazing and funny after giving me some great parking suggestions. So my friends made it back and told me they’re stay was amazing. So I’m totally looking forward to my New Years stay coming up,We stay at the Crowne Plaza West Loop because of its location to great restaurants, access to downtown venues and its location to family.  We continue to come back again and again because of the great customer service!  We recently stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday.  The employees were friendly and accommodating to our needs while we were there.  Jonathan, the Bellman was especially helpful as we got to our room and were settled.  He continued to greet us over the next three days!  We enjoyed our visit.,Had a great stay however I mistakenly left my credit card in the hotels restaurant just before I left.  When I got home I called the front desk and Simeon jumped right on it and made sure my card was secured and mailed it to me right away.  Thanks Simeon and Crowne Plaza Chicago!,Dear stevenevison11,,Thank you kindly for your review and being our recent guest.

Cambria Hotel & Suites Chicago Loop - Theatre District,"This was our first time in Chicago, and this hotel was perfectly located.  Easy walk to the Oriental Theatre, as it is right next door.  Easy walk to Millenium Park.  Easy walk to The Art Institute.  Easy Uber to Willis Tower and Navy Pier.  The beds were comfy.  The room was quiet.  The only thing to not like about this hotel is the price of valet parking.  It is $67.00 a night.  But, it is 4 star service.  They whisk your car away.  Give you a ticket, and when you are ready to leave, you just text the number on the voucher that they give you and they park your car right in front of the hotel for you.  I would stay here again if driving to Chicago and seeing a show.,Wow! I can't say enough good about this hotel.  The rooms are amazing and modern, street noise completely blocked.  And when we had a minor issue with housekeeping Alec, the supervisor went above and beyond.  Not only got us fresh towels but walked us to our room carrying them for us! He was super accommodating and recommended some amazing adventures for us.  We had such a nice stay we are already planning to come back.  Albeit, I hope Alec has been promoted by then because this guy is what you hope every hotel supervisor is like! ,This Hotel was very clean, and an amazing walking distance from anywhere you wanted to go. Staff was amazing, great housekeeping and very helpful front desk, especially Alec. He gave us amazing restaurant recommendations and booked my mom a massage. The breakfast was delicious as well. I would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion. We personally ubered everywhere we went, so I don’t have much knowledge about parking, but the hotel itself was amazing. I definitely want to come back.,Heather,Thank you for staying with us at the Cambria Chicago Loop Theatre District!  We are glad you had such an amazing time at our location.  We are very pleased Alec was able to help you so much with everything!  We hope to see you again in the near future.,Conveniently located in theater district. Comfortable rooms. ,Terrible valet service. Even when we text to request car 40 minutes ahead we still didn't get our car. ,Being late put a sour taste on the entire stay and the staff didn't really seem to care ,So stay here but park elsewhere ,Hi Lorraine,We are sorry to hear that you had terrible valet service and that the staff didn't seem to care.  Your feedback is very important to us and we will use this to make sure we improve this experience for all of our guest. We do hope that you will stay with us again so we can show you the quality of service we pride ourselves in having.,Stayed here with my kids for a weekend trip and to see a show at the Chicago theater.

Courtyard Chicago Midway Airport,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights the end of March for work. The rooms have everything you need, water was hot and pressure was good. Their is a TGIF that it tied to the hotel and you can access from inside the hotel. Shuttle runs frequently to and from Midway. This place does not disappoint. ,We spent a quick night here with the family before flying out of Midway for a week.  Beats having to get up super early and drive 2 1/2 hours for a flight!  Very nice lobby and room.  Shuttle bus to airport was quick and driver friendly.,I stayed here 3 nights while in town for business. The room was very clean and comfortable. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I even got a little “washcloth animal” from housekeeping one day. I ate at the Bistro for breakfast twice and the classic oatmeal and coconut milk latte were delicious! Usually I like to eat at the Bistro in the evenings sometimes to but since this hotel is connected to a TGI Friday’s the Bistro is not open in the evening. I never saw anyone using the pool but it looked nice and the gym was small but I was the only one in there after work so it served its purpose. There is of course airplane noise but so close to the airport that’s expected and it didn’t bother me. I’d definitely stay here again! ,We booked a room here because we had an early flight the next morning. As we were pulling up to the hotel, we received a text that our flight was canceled due to fog ☹️ as we scrambled to call the airline, it was so nice to be greeted by Sarah. She was friendly and efficient. The room was huge, clean and exactly what we needed.  ,I stay here on a regular basis. Everyone is always welcoming and goes out of their way to put the customer first.  Quiet, clean and comfortable rooms.  Easy shuttles to-from the airport and great food at the TGI Friday's attached to the hotel.  Other food choices close by within walking distance.  Can't say enough about the hotel and staff.",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d90766-r571944711-Courtyard_Chicago_Midway_Airport-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"If you're looking for a great night of sleep, look elsewhere. The beds at Best Western Grant Park felt like trash bags filled with debris. The bed my kids slept in did not have a center support beam and it bowed badly in the middle (staff chose not to repair it or relocate us). The room was also VERY crowded and our family of 4 struggled to move around in it. The TV also did not work, but that wasn't a real high priority for us, though. As for the good stuff, we picked the hotel for the location (close to museums, etc.) and that did not disappoint. All things considered, for $100 in Chicago, we probably got what we paid for.,It was in a Fabulous location! Staff is super friendly and accommodating! Room was clean and had everything we needed except a refrigerator. Walking distance to Grand park, millennium Park, field museum and many other tourist sites!,Friendly staff and nice, clean rooms. Being so close to the Field museum, aquarium, planetarium and train line worked out great, too. Made it quite easy to go to and from the airport. I'd definitely stay here again.,Thank you for sharing your review and for recognizing our team and clean rooms which our housekeeping team deliver with pride. We are in a great location that has so much to offer and within walking distance. We also have a great restaurant connected to the hotel and have many other great places for dining within walking distance as well which our team can gladly guide our guest too. We hope to have the opportunity in seeing back soon.,The staff at this hotel will keep us coming back. Extremely friendly and warm. I felt like they would bend over backwards to make our stay happy. The location near the parks/museum campus is great. Our room had VERY VERY VERY noisy guests next to us from 11pm to 3am, so that was a bummer, not the hotel's fault, though (I didn't call the front desk to complain, so they wouldn't have known it was happening). The manager, Octovio, is WONDERFUL. We will come back.,We appreciate you, thank you for recognizing our team and for sharing your experience from your recent stay. We are all excited to read you had a great stay with us while visiting our wonderful city. We also thank you for letting us know what areas we can improve one.

The Buckingham Club,"Hello rschwa225948-,Thanks for the five stars, gotta love that!  We're so glad you were able to take advantage of our Buckingham.AC facilities, we're really proud of all the fantastic offerings they have to offer.  We're anticipating a brand new restaurant to open on the plaza this fall as well, perfect for an outdoor happy hour or light bite.  We hope you come visit us again soon.,First of all it was really hard to find the hotel as there is no sign outside. So, do your online research first to know how the front door looks. The security is really tight so expect to use two entry cards; one for getting to the elevators and the second to go to your room. the rooms look nice but there is some wear and tear so the feeling is something between clean and old. If you book this for business you'll be satisfied.,Hey dkonto543994, thanks for the review!  We certainly understand our facility can get a little confusing in terms of location and navigation, it's something we're actively working on and hope to have some of those changes implemented soon!  Also in the works... updates to the rooms!  We've been making some minor improvements and will continue to do so, please come stay with us again in the future and check it out, we promise you won't be disappointed! ,Really, really, really friendly staff, excellent views of city, a bit confusing parking, great value, quick continental breakfast included in room rate. Did not get to try athletic club, though have heard tremendously positive things about it. Hotel near much of downtown attractions! Will be going back for sure!,We're so happy to have had you! Thanks for staying with us and we hope you'll visit again soon.,Overall the stay was disappointing. Stayed at the hotel over the weekend, the main selling feature of the hotel was the access to the beautiful gym facilities - these were only open between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm on weekends which aren't conducive to business travelers needing to use the facilities before work or for leisure travelers looking to get an early start. The rooms were also incredibly dark even with ALL the lights on! ,Hello,,We're sorry to hear you were disappointed with your stay at The Buckingham Hotel, we strive to make each of our guests experience memorable in the most positive of ways.  Though we share a name, the Buckingham.AC fitness facility is a separate entity from the Hotel, and in such they make their own hours.   Please accept our apologies that you weren't able to take full advantage of the facilities.,I will never get tired of staying in this secret hotel! This visit our room was facing the lake, last visit the room was directly across from the Willis Tower!  The gym/spa is phenomenal and the third floor eatery as well as cocktail bar are fantastic and so convenient.  Set directly above the CBOE - it’s perfect for our needs and wants!,Well thanks Heather, we're so happy to hear that you've enjoyed your time with us!  We hope we'll always stay your favorite!,This place is amazing. I have stayed at many hotels, but this one blew us away. It isn't the typical hotel. Only 21 rooms, but wonderfully appointed rooms with a view of Chicago. All the rooms are on the 40th floor.,We think you're amazing too, Alan.  Thanks for taking the time to write us a note!",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d498305-r571060933-The_Buckingham_Club-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"Thank you for sharing your review. By telling us what you liked and what we can improve on, it helps us continue to deliver our valued guest a great experience from when staying with us.

Whether you're here for business or pleasure, there is something for everybody and really convenient from our location in taking public transportation to  explore our wonderful city. We hope to see you back in the future.,This hotel suited our needs perfectly for a weekend trip to the Field Museum in the dead of winter. The room was small and basic, but we didn't go to Chicago for the weekend to hang out in the room. It was clean, warm (we actually turned the air on in the room...and it was about -2 outside), comfortable beds. The coffee bar in the lobby was perfect in the morning. We walked to the Museum, there are multiple restaurants in walking distance (we chose Giordano's and Chicago Burger Bar--highly recommend both). Short, cheap Uber or Lyft to other parts of the city. If you are looking for luxury and amenities this probably isn't the place for you, but if you are just looking for a place to sleep after a day in the city, this is the best value in all of Chicago.,We thank you for sharing your review. We are glad you had a great experience from your recent stay. We are in a great location that has so much to offer, whether you're here for business or leisure, there is something for everyone and our team can gladly guide you through.

Our housekeeping team has won the housekeeping award based on cleanliness and enjoy taking time in completing those little details that help enhance our guest experience from when staying with us. We hope to see you back soon.,The location is perfect. Close access to metra and walking distance to museum campus. Easy walk to Roosevelt station if you need to get on the el. Very short drive to navy pier. The only real complaint is price for parking but what do you expect for downtown Chicago. Hotel staff was above and beyond friendly and accommodating. Not sure why any previous reviews state differently. The rooms are spacious. No fridge but you can pay for one which would be nice if it were included like most hotels. ,Will definitely stay here again in the future.,Thank you for sharing your review. By telling us what you liked and what we can improve on it helps us continue to deliver superior customer service and a great experience. We have a great team dedicated to all of our valued guest.

My fiancee and i asked the staff several times for places to visit and see and were told to google it instead. It was our time in chicago and didnt know the city. The one time they did give a place to go it was the wrong directions!,We are sorry to hear that your recent stay with us did not exceed your expectations. We appreciate your feedback and will use it to make improvements to offer guests a better experience in the future. We hope you will give us another chance and stay with us again. -Best Western Hotels & Resorts",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d114583-r554099429-Best_Western_Grant_Park_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Chicago Marriott O'Hare,"...it is warm and inviting on the inside. My room was a bit on the small side but clean and comfortable and perfectly fine for one guest. The lobby is spacious and the bar area offers seating for working with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine in hand. There is not much within walking distance of the hotel (in terms of dining or shopping) but there are some nice neighborhoods nearby to offer a safe and relatively pleasant outside run. One plus, of courses its close proximity to O'Hare (3 miles away or so).,We stayed here for a Park and Fly on our way to Mexico.  We had an early flight, so we only had about 9 hours between check in and check out.  We had no complaints about the room - beds were comfortable (although we prefer queens over doubles) and bathroom was clean.  The transportation to the airport went as we expected.  However, when we returned from our trip my husband called to tell the hotel we needed transportation back.  He was told where we should stand outside the airport.  They said it would be about 15 minutes.  We waited 30 minutes and they didn't arrive, so he called back.  They didn't know what happened, saying that maybe the van was full and that was why we weren't picked up.  They said a van should be there in another 20 minutes.  We were finally picked up nearly an hour after our original call.  Other hotel vans drove by multiple times while we waited.  Next time we will stay at one of those hotels for our Park and Fly.,Thank you for your review.  We apologize for the shuttle issue, and it has been addressed with the appropriate managers.  What you experienced certainly isn't typical, and we hope you'll give us another chance in the future.  Thank you for staying with us.,We held our national sales meeting here March 5-8. Everyone we encountered during our stay (banquets team, Sarah Miller) were phenomenal! ,My room was on the 8th floor, nice and clean and the most comfy bed ever! The only thing I was missing during my stay was a fridge to keep my water cold.,Thank you for making our event seamless! ,This is really an excellent hotel for a park in fly.  There are two restaurants onsite and several within walking distance.  Rooms are really nice and quiet.  The offer good views of Chicago.  The shuttle service is very convenient.,Well we were coming home from Vail to Syracuse and unfortunately there was bad weather in Syracuse and our flight was cancelled and no available flights for the next day.   I used points for our two nights.   We checked in and received a nice room and since the concierge level wasn’t open on the weekend we got certificates for the breakfast buffet for two days fo the wife and I.   The buffet was awesome and catered to my needs of egg whites.  Service was great at the buffet, bar, front desk and housekeeping.     There is a reason I’m Platinum for life at Marriott it’s because they are consistently consistent.

Best Western Grant Park Hotel,"We stayed on the 6th floor of the hotel. The window view was disappointing, not a big deal for a big city. Our room had some ceiling defects and the ceiling was falling down in the corner. Parking want included in the hotel fees. That was a bit of a downer. The location was great we were in walking distance of everything. However the hotel staff double booked our room and it was a scary experience for my children and I. We were woken up by strangers trying to get to their room. These things just made it an average stay, I may not return to this hotel based on the negatives.,If you're looking for a great night of sleep, look elsewhere. The beds at Best Western Grant Park felt like trash bags filled with debris. The bed my kids slept in did not have a center support beam and it bowed badly in the middle (staff chose not to repair it or relocate us). The room was also VERY crowded and our family of 4 struggled to move around in it. The TV also did not work, but that wasn't a real high priority for us, though. As for the good stuff, we picked the hotel for the location (close to museums, etc.) and that did not disappoint. All things considered, for $100 in Chicago, we probably got what we paid for.,It was in a Fabulous location! Staff is super friendly and accommodating! Room was clean and had everything we needed except a refrigerator. Walking distance to Grand park, millennium Park, field museum and many other tourist sites!,Friendly staff and nice, clean rooms. Being so close to the Field museum, aquarium, planetarium and train line worked out great, too. Made it quite easy to go to and from the airport. I'd definitely stay here again.,Thank you for sharing your review and for recognizing our team and clean rooms which our housekeeping team deliver with pride. We are in a great location that has so much to offer and within walking distance. We also have a great restaurant connected to the hotel and have many other great places for dining within walking distance as well which our team can gladly guide our guest too. We hope to have the opportunity in seeing back soon.,The staff at this hotel will keep us coming back. Extremely friendly and warm. I felt like they would bend over backwards to make our stay happy. The location near the parks/museum campus is great. Our room had VERY VERY VERY noisy guests next to us from 11pm to 3am, so that was a bummer, not the hotel's fault, though (I didn't call the front desk to complain, so they wouldn't have known it was happening). The manager, Octovio, is WONDERFUL. We will come back.,We appreciate you, thank you for recognizing our team and for sharing your experience from your recent stay. We are all excited to read you had a great stay with us while visiting our wonderful city. We also thank you for letting us know what areas we can improve one. Our guest feedback is what helps us improve and we are grateful we had the opportunity in accommodating you which we hope we get to see you back soon. The location has so much to offer, for instance we are within walking distance to many great attractions and dining options, which our team is always glad to assist and help create a great memory from visiting Chicago. I'm glad I was able to get the opportunity in assisting you and if I can be at any further assistance, please feel free in reaching out to me directly at  312 922 2900 or by email at ogonzalez@bwgrantparkhotel.com .

Rooms and service were excellent. I was upgraded to a suite that was very comfortable and clean.,If I have one major complaint, it's with the parking. Some one came up with the idea to charge $32 a night for uncovered self parking. What a total rip-off and reason alone to avoid this location if your driving a car.

Hyatt Place Chicago/Downtown - The Loop,"Great location!,Near restaurants, sights. Very accessible to transport. ,With free breakfast. ,Large suite rooms. Large windows.,Bed covers linens sheets need refreshing. ,Free bottled water  would have been nice. ,Thank you for the review and the suggestions!  We appreciate your business and hope to host you again soon!,Nice, clean hotel in the loop area of Chicago.  Less than a 5 minute walk to Willis Tower (plus a Giordano's), a 20 minute walk to Michigan Ave, the river walk is only three blocks away- other words, great location.  Bar area is very clean, onsite food is good.  Room is great.  Stay here and you will be satisfied.,Thanks wisctravfamily!  Sounds like you were able to do quite a bit of exploring!  Great fun packed weekend!  Thanks for taking the time to share your experience, come see us again soon!,We choose this hotel because we had tickets to see Hamilton and it was a 10 minute walk to the theatre. It was well located to the theatre district, but a bit out of the way to the touristy stuff. There is a train stop pretty close by, but we took a lot of Uber/Lyfts to get where we needed to go. We parked a car in the Poetry Garage, which is the recommended place to park. It was $40 a night. I recommend going on their website to get the pre-pay discount. It was very easy to get in and out of with the pre-pay pass. The garage was located about a block from the hotel. ,When we checked in, they asked if we wanted a street view or a quiet room. I have had bad experiences with traffic noise in downtown Chicago hotels, so I opted for the quiet room. I sort of regretted it because the room pretty much directly faced another building in an inner courtyard and I had no view. It made the room dark and basement-like despite being on the 16th floor. ,The room/hotel itself was nice and everything you'd expect from a Hyatt Place. The breakfast was a little lacking for Hyatt Place, especially on Saturday morning. We obviously hit the rush and they were running out of a lot of things. ,All in all this was a solid hotel, but next time I'll probably choose to stay a little closer to the action.,Thanks for the review and feedback tmccullough!  I appreciate you taking the time to let us know how we are doing.  We situated in the heart of the theater district and just blocks from most of the popular attractions.  Certainly would hope to be the top choice for your next visit!  Thanks again for the review! ,In the city of Chicago, the Hyatt Place Chicago Loop is a clear winner. Here are the reasons I am voting for this hotel. LOCATION-The Hyatt Place is in the ‘loop’ giving it a clear advantage for folks wanting to see the top attractions. It is only a 10-minute walk from the main train station. The Art Institute, one of the great museums in the US, is a 12-minute walk from the hotel. The Willis Tower (former Sears Tower) is a 9-minute walk. Millennium Park with Cloud Gate (locally called the ‘Bean’) and the entertaining facial water fountains is a 12-minute walk. Finally, one of the best ever children’s playground area is a short 14-minute walk. When you combined all of these tourist sites along with the ease of hopping on the ‘L-train’ or the many busses that come by this area and traveling to the other Chicago attractions, makes this location superb. OUTSIDE APPEARANCE-We traveled to Chicago with our grandsons via Amtrak. When we first walked up to the hotel, the outside appearance struck me as modern and very pleasing to the eye. The name HYATT PLACE is clearly visible at the top of this building. The building itself blends in well with surrounding buildings. The hotel has a great outside look. SECURITY-This hotel is in one of the best areas in Chicago. The hotel is surrounded by several banks, hi-rise business offices, top restaurants, and stores. The Hyatt Center is just down the street from the hotel. We walked around the neighborhood with our grandsons and saw no need to be concern. It is a secure area. Inside the hotel the elevators can only go up if a room key is used giving another level of security. We felt very secure in this hotel. ROOMS-My family loves Hyatt Place because the rooms are generally slightly larger than other similar priced hotels. In our room, we had two queen size beds and a large sleeper sofa plus a desk area. The bathroom was large enough for me to shave and my wife to comfortably put on her makeup at the same time. Our grandsons enjoyed the shower with plenty of hot water. The mini-frig had several shelves and door storage plus it was cold. Often mini-frigs in hotels are just cool but this one was actually cold. Our waters each morning were cold and that is a nice plus. SOUND-Being in a big city sound can be problem, especially if you are trying to sleep. These rooms are built well because we rarely heard any outside sounds, from either the hallway or the street. BREAKFAST-I love breakfast at a Hyatt Place because they vary the items on the hot breakfast bar. Instead of getting the same thing every morning, Hyatt Place gives a little variety. The Hyatt Place Loop does a great job in this. The breakfast personnel were especially nice and kept the items filled to the top. Here is a tip to the hat to AMBER CHOPP for making our trip so special. Amber and the breakfast staff go all out to make each stay special. STAFF-Here’s the biggest reason I am heavily recommending the Hyatt Place Chicago Loop. AARON OSHEROFF, the general manager, has assembled a great staff. Each person made an extra effort on our behalf when any request was made. A special shout out to Maria, Maiana and Latonia! They were all special. COST-The Hyatt Place compares very well in cost to other Chicago hotels we have used in the past. Based on my experiences at Chicago hotels, one would have to pay 15-20% more to get the same quality as the Hyatt Place Chicago Loop. We are already planning our next trip to Chicago and you had better believe we will stay at this hotel. It is a winner!,Thank you ArkansasMinister!  Happy to hear you enjoyed everything Chicago and the Hyatt Place - The Loop has to offer!  Thanks for choosing to celebrate with us and please come see us again soon!  Thanks again!,Let me tell you, from the moment our family of four walked into the doors of the establishment, we were greeted by a friendly, personable professional named Maria.  She was able to check us in, despite arriving in the early morning and made the check in experience go smoothly.,The breakfast was outstanding and the rooms were clean. ,Thank you, Hyatt Place, for making our visit memorable!,Thanks Stevo74!  I will be sure to share your comments with Maria!  Happy to hear you enjoyed your experience and we were even able to accommodate an early check in.

Hyatt Place Chicago/Downtown - The Loop,"An excellent stay and good value for the money in downtown Chicago. The room includes a nice breakfast, with both hot and cold choices. When visiting Chicago, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,My husband and 26 year old son stayed for one night on a trip to Chicago to see the musical Hamilton.  The location was perfect for us, only 6-8 blocks from the CIBC Theater.  The breakfast is especially good and it is very convenient to be able to have breakfast at the hotel rather than going out.,All I have to say is WOW! I came here for a trade show and ended up getting the stomach flu. They cleaned my room extra, brought me water, Gatorade, Tylenol, and even came to check on me! Now that’s service. Will definitely be back!,the overall experience at the hotel was as expected for a Hyatt. the staff welcomed us and provided as much help as possible. the rooms were clean and comfy. will definitely stay again especially for free breakfast,Loved our two day stay.  Friendly staff prompt service clean rooms, hotel and pool.  Comfortable beds.  Excellent breakfast. Will definitely seek out this brand on other destinations and plan to stay again on our next visit to Chicago.",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d7905734-r572547551-Hyatt_Place_Chicago_Downtown_The_Loop-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown West Loop,"Dear Laura F,,Thank you for taking your time to write about your experience at our hotel. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us.  We will definitely let Erica (lady at the front desk) know about her awesome service. We look forward to welcome you back to our hotel when travel plans bring you back in Chicago.,Hotel was a great location to all the wonderful things Chicago has to offer.   Would recommend this location to anyone.   100+ night a year tracker and this location and hotel is wonderful.   Can’t beat location location location.   ,Dear Francis B,,  We appreciate your feedback and thank you for your loyalty to our Hilton family and to our property.  When you're in town please make sure to come back and stay with us.,Warm Regards,,Lorena Gonzalez,This is a great location - just a few blocks from Union Station.  The beds & bedding are very comfortable.  The lobby and rooms look like they have recently been remodeled and are nicely done.  Everything was really clean.  The staff and especially the parking attendants were extremely helpful.,Dear myohmyoh, ,Thank you for taking your time to write about your experience at our hotel. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we look forward to welcome you back to our hotel when travel plans bring you back in Chicago.,Warm Regards,,Lorena Gonzalez,The front room/ eating area was well kept as well as the room. parking became troublesome as I was unaware that you had to park your car if you weren't using a valet and walk in to then see you had to go to the 4th floor for registration/check-in which became confusing because there are two hotels in one so trying to figure out which desk to go to was frustrating as well as trying to find the right elevators. The rest of the stay was ok. The beds were not very comfy. The pool had part of the mat at the steps that was loose and floating upward which caused me to almost trip and the bathrooms in the pool area were freezing when we tried to go in them.,Dear meghanb24,,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel.  We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we are very sorry we did not exceed your expectations. Your comments will help us as we continually work to improve our guest experience. Please contact me direct at the email or phone number below if there is anything else we can do for you at this time.

I travel to Chicago often for work and lately i have always chosen this property. The hotel is clean, rooms are good size, WiFi is good. There is free breakfast. This time around I got a corner room and s huge. The staff is always very helpful and courteous. They will continue to get my business for my visits to Chicago.,Dear Yeshwant N,,  I would like to thank you for you're loyalty to the Hilton family and especially to our property!  We'll see you soon!,Warm Regards,,Lorena Gonzalez,Newer construction. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Pillows and towels were ample. Shower was large with terrific water pressure. Pool is on small size, but more than adequate, and well-maintained. Deck (although snow-covered) looked well-appointed and appealing. Staff were pleasant and helpful (props to Tiffany who patiently coped when my 'senior moment' made check-in more difficult than necessary). Breakfast was amazing. Good variety of offerings. Staff was very attentive, keeping area tidy and quickly refilling trays.,Workers continued to bring hot, fresh food right up to closing time -- a thoughtful 10 am. Equally thoughtful, staff signalled closing time and patiently waited out the last-minute surge. No room service, but lots of nearby restaurants and delivery options. Best surprise feature was a self-service laundry.,Dear Welikehotels,, ,  We appreciate your feedback and we are glad that you had a wonderful experience at our hotel.  We will definitely share your kind words with Tiffany! We hope to see you in the near future.,Best Regards,,Lorena Gonzalez",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d10632906-r553756814-Hampton_Inn_Chicago_Downtown_West_Loop-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Conrad Chicago,"Dear Lisa P, ,Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago. It seems you enjoyed everything about your stay from the views and location all the way down to the team members friendly and helpful service. Thank you for taking time from your day to give us a 5 star review and allowing us any opportunity to welcome you back for future stays. ,Sincerely, ,Tod Chambers,The housekeeping continued to miss our room for cleaning.  After sleeping in the first night, we used the “make the room” button to signal for service to the room.  However, no one serviced the room upon our return in the evening.  After sleeping late the second night, we called the desk for service. Even after the desk agreed to send housekeeping to the room, no one showed up.  ,Dear Pvainikos, ,Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago. I'm terribly sorry for the housekeeping service request issues that you experienced during your stay and will use this information to provide feedback to the team to ensure that we improve the experience for future guests and yourself. I hope we have the chance to welcome you back and that this did not deter you from staying with us again. ,Sincerely, ,Tod Chambers,Great hotel right off Mag Mile. Fantastic service. Great experience. Requested rooms near each other and staff was great in accommodating. When leaving, the staff brought luggage and put in car while we shopped on the Mag Mile for a bit. Great service. Beds were great, too.,Dear Michael S, ,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago. I'm glad you and your family enjoyed your time with us and our team was accommodating, friendly, and provided intuitive service by having your luggage put in your car while you were enjoying Michigan Avenue. We look forward to welcome you back. ,Kind Regards, ,Tod Chambers,A great spot with great service!  Steps from Michigan Ave shopping and many wonderful restaurants.  Fitness center was well done and has lots of options. Looking forward to trying the rooftop restaurant/bar in warmer weather.  ,Dear davidoT112WZ, ,Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago and giving us a 5 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay, our location and fitness center. We look forward to welcome back when the weather is warmer and you can enjoy the rooftop. ,Sincerely, ,Tod Chambers,We are from the Chicagoland area and brought our kids downtown for a few days after Christmas.    The quality of the rooms were fantastic.  We had a spacious room which was very clean.    The hotel location was perfect for getting around to activities.   ,Dear 602chicagotraveler, ,I'm glad you were able to use our hotel as your stay-cation getaway for you and your family to get to enjoy some time together. The team was able to take great care of you and your family and enjoyed doing so. Thank you for sharing your feedback, we look forward to welcome you back. ,Kind Regards, ,Tod Chambers,Booked one of the two Presidential Suites--very clean but decor and layout were a bust. Not sure why hotel decorators & designers insist on using overly bulky drapes that can't be fully pulled away from windows nor why when a room has floor to ceiling windows with an incredible view, they block it with furniture--why not arrange furniture facing OUT to the view and float the furniture as in this case there was plenty of room.  Use room darkening solar shades instep of bulky dusty drapes that are not attractive to being with.,Black floors in baths show every water spot, closets were awkward and color palette of orange and white was more suited to Palm Springs than Chicago--too bright and distracting.,Sofa in Living room was just ""tossed"" together--looks like housekeeping did not attempt to put sofa pillows in some sort of order after the last guest left. Nice desk area with great view, but only two outlets that were already utilized by phone and lamp so no where to plug in cell charger or laptop.  Desk chair was heavy and not easy to move.,Restaurant staff was certainly not warm and fuzzy--no car service as advertised--no real amenities and top floor lobby was oddly placed. Mini bar in room was empty and not stocked with refreshments as website indicated.,Concierge was awesome--room service folks were great too, but rest of staff mediocre.,All in all for 1200.00 a night I would pass next time and consider The Peninsula or Ritz.,Dear Mark A, ,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago. I'm sorry the interior design of our rooms and hotel were not to your liking. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your overall stay due to the items you mentioned but glad you at least found it clean while you were with us. ,Kind Regards, ,Tod Chambers",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d10211870-r551207699-Conrad_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Silversmith Hotel Chicago Downtown,"Silversmith is perfectly located in the Chicago Loop.  No more than 1 mile walk up beautiful Michigan Ave, 3 blocks from the Art Institute and Grant Park.  Also 1 mile walk from 2 Metro trains and the ""EL"" right at your front door.  That, however, might be a problem for many people, as all rooms look right out at the tracks above Wabash Street.  There is a continuous rumbling all day and NIGHT.  For my husband and I this was white noise, as we live right next to O'Hare  Airport.  We were given an upgrade in our room because even at 3:10 in the afternoon, our room was not ready.   The upgrade was nothing but a larger room.   The amenities were sparse.  There was no glass in the bathroom or the entire room to get water to take medication or brushing teeth.  Had to use the paper coffee cup located in a cabinet.  Also, there was no printed TV channel guide and most importantly no printed material describing the services in the hotel.  Lastly,  was disappointed in that there was not one printed brochure, pamplet etc. about tourist information in the room.  Over all the staff was friendly and the room served its purpose.,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. We are thrilled to see that you enjoyed our hotel's location. We appreciate your honest comments about the amenities, printed material in the room. We will pass along your suggestions to our team and General Manager to make the appropriate changes. If you would like to discuss your stay in more detail please reach out to our General Manager, Frank at frank.leone@silversmithhotel.com. ,I stayed here overnight for a business conference. The hotel is conveniently located near shops and restaurants. The train station kiosk is literally outside the hotel front door. My room was on a high floor facing the street. I could hear the trains pass every 5 mins. which was OK with me but may not be for a light sleeper. The decor is beautiful and the bath products are wonderful. Customer service was great and rate was reasonable for the area. I didn't get to try the food but the menu looked yummy. The only complaint is there was no room service menu in the room. I had to ask for it at the front desk and it did not have most of the items that is on their restaurant/bar menu. Overall, a great place to stay and a great deal. The room does have a mini fridge and wifi was free.,Loved this hotel - great location on Wabash Ave with the El running right long the street outside.  Walking distance to River Nth, Mag Mile and Museum Mile/Millennium Park.,There are a lot of great restaurants nearby and the bar at the hotel is a lovely place for a pre-dinner drink.  The rooms are a great size and the decor is lovely.  I'd definitely stay here again!,Stayed 1 night. In town to tour MLB stadiums. Great stay, had a double bed in the upper floors. Room/decor was clean and location was great. Parking within the hotel is ver expensive for 1 night ($60). Staff was very attentive. Walking distance to all, considering coming back next time I’m in town. ,So glad we decided to stay at the Silversmith for our weekend getaway. We thought it was very reasonable for the excellent quality accommodations and wonderful service. Great location to park your car for the weekend and walk to everything. Beautiful, comfortable room. We stayed on the third floor and the L train went right by our window but noise was NOT an issue. They must’ve installed soundproof glass. We slept beautifully both nights. Extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Lovely bathroom. Extraordinarily friendly and accommodating staff. Can’t wait to go back!",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d90975-r534836678-Silversmith_Hotel_Chicago_Downtown-Chicago_Illinois.html>

From the polite, funny doormen that greet you to the wonderful toiletries in the room. Jose, the Concierge , was way beyond helpful.  Every place he recommended to visit or eat at was great. The fitness room was so nice..don't forget to bring a water bottle! If I need to make another trip to Chicago, this is the place I will definitely book...no doubt about it. Great location, great staff, great room...it's a no brainer.,Hi Sally,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you had a wonderful experience interacting with members of our team. We will sure to pass along the kind words.,We would love to welcome you back to our hotel again soon. ,Thanks again.,This was our first stay at the Londonhouse in Chicago.  We came for our 25th wedding anniversary to celebrate with friends.  The hotel let us upgrade for a discounted fee to the Vista suite on the 13th floor.  We had a spectacular view of the Chicago River and the city.  The suite was upscale, modern and well appointed.  They even provide guests with the standard toiletries like shampoos, soaps etc but also body wash, body sponge and toothbrushes.  We loved the shower too, perfect size and water temp and pressure.  The Vista suite has a floor to ceiling window view.  These rooms are the only ones that have that.  Cool elevator system.  You select your floor before getting into the elevator and this directs you to the appropriate elevator to take.  No numbers are inside the elevators.  The rooftop bar was closed for a private party, but I did get one photo just as it was closing.  A nice outdoor atmosphere.  There are restaurants and other bars in the hotel.  A Corner Bakery restaurant is on the first floor.  Nice place for breakfast or lunch.  The staff was very accommodating at the front desk.  Great hotel in a great location. ,Hi 3Rudes,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit for your 25th anniversary - congratulations! We are also happy to hear that you were able to upgrade to a Vista suite and that you appreciated the beautiful views offered from the room.,We would love to welcome you back to our hotel again soon. ,Thanks again.,From the moment I arrived, the staff was super friendly and courteous.  I opted for the upgrade upon checking in to have a view of the Chicago River--  WELL WORTH IT!  I was on the 19th floor and the city and river view were amazing.  The room was very clean (very important to me), I had everything I needed, and the rooftop bar is incredible.  I will definitely stay here again when in Chicago!,Hi D5782BCjennifert,,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you had a wonderful experience interacting with members of our team.,We would love to welcome you back to our hotel again soon. ,Thanks again.,Brandy, one of the front desk managers was delightful (personable, connecting) and so was the front desk manager.

"Hotel EMC2, Autograph Collection","Gaby L, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave a 5-star review from your recent stay!  We are happy you enjoyed the room and the location of the hotel.  We pride ourselves on our attention to detail and cleanliness here at Hotel EMC2.  Our entire team is looking forward to welcoming you back for another stay very soon. ,Allyson Murphy,Front Office Manager ,The minute you walk up on EMC2, you know there’s something different about this hotel, where the futuristic meshes with the traditional, yet with the comfort and service you’d expect of an Autograph Collection hotel. Art and bookcases fill the walls with hip-dark touches and two robots, Leo and Cleo, sitting next to the reception desk. The staff are skilled and efficient and soon have you selecting your elevator destination from outside the bank of very fast elevators (no button pushing inside the elevator). The hallways mix the quirky and electronic art in motion with dark accents and a twist of magnifying glasses over the room numbers. The rooms are smallish but well-appointed with extremely comfortable, high-quality beds and linens, plenty of electronics (including your own personal Amazon Echo), and electronic lighting controls with a myriad of lighting choices. We were early Echo tester (Alexa is a staple in our house), so we really appreciated having our own Echo to listen to music, ask questions, etc. The closets are decent sized behind a curtain that can run around the glass shower that sits in the middle of the room—yes, the shower is interestingly the anchor of the room. The bathroom itself is small but nicely appointed. Need a toiletry item or bottle of water? Just text one of the robots to bring it up—yes, make sure you utilize the robots for some fun (though, only the great human staff can deliver alcohol or food). It’s pretty interesting to be entering an elevator and have on the robots join you on the ride up and get off the floor before you, merrily carrying out its delivery tasks. Location, location, location—this hotel sits just off the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago, very convenient to shopping, restaurants, and attractions, so forego the rental car and enjoy the city from your own private central base camp. The price is a right on target; I rate this as a great value for a stay in downtown Chicago for the mix of unique and comfortable accommodations, great staff, perfect location, and right price point. Highly recommended.,Robert H,,Thank you for taking the time to leave such a detailed review form your visit!  We loved reading about your visit and are happy you enjoyed all of the unique elements that make up Hotel EMC2!  Our staff was happy to see your feedback, including Leo & Cleo!

I travel to Chicago often and usually stay at other Marriott properties, but while consistent it does get old.   So I thought I’d try this new hotel in the autograph collection. ,The Hotel is relatively new ( less than a year),  the rooms are very cool with lots of brass and hardwood floors.  The room felt bigger that it was due to the shower being glass enclosed and open to the room.  This would normally be where the wall separating the bathroom from the room,  but being glass made the room feel large. There is a curtain that you can draw for privacy.  ,Leo and Cleo are the hotel robots that delivery stuff to your room if needed.  ,The lounge and restaurant on site was service Easter menus but the few appetizers I had were delicious. ,Location being 1 block north of Michigan Avenue is great.  I’ve changed my future reservations to stay there when I return. ,Keith H, ,Thank you for the wonderful comments from your recent visit to Hotel EMC2.

That is a great feature if it's thundering outside and want to watch something until the rain passes. Beds were super comfortable! Got the best sleep ever!

We look forward to being your home away from home the next time your travels bring you to Chicago!,Allyson Murphy,Front Office Manager ,We were celebrating my daughter's 16th birthday and took a trip to the city overnight from Eastern Iowa.  My sister lives in the burbs so she was coming into the city to hang with us.  This hotel exceeded our expectations even after reading all of the reviews.  I have traveled all over the US and staying in uber fancy hotels to dive motels.  This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in, although the pool at Excalibur in Vegas is pretty damn cool.  The rooms are very nice, we got a double queen.  The shower was totally amazing and big enough to fit half a dozen people comfortably.  ,Now the technology is another story.  From the electronic ever changing art outside of the elevator on each floor to Leo and Cleo the house robots; this place has it all when it comes to the tech age.  Alexa in every room, Netflix installed on the tv.  The lights have master controls on the wall and through the tv.  ,I also can't say enough about the staff!  Lux was fantastic!  We had an issue with our CC card not swiping and she was more than gracious and helpful to get us checked in.  She was sweet and bright.  Dwayne was more than outgoing and helpful, not only that he was funny too.  I spoke to the manager to tell her how well they were doing and she was also very upbeat and friendly.  ,My 16 year old was ecstatic about this stay, we will certainly be going back!  The first thing she said, and then repeated several times over our stay, ""I wanna live here!"",HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,Trish H, ,Thank you for leaving such a fantastic review!  Our entire team was so happy to read your feedback and are delighted they could ensure your stay was seamless.  Lux and Dwayne do a fantastic job and are excited you had a great visit.  Hotel EMC2 is inspired by Art & Science and is a hotel unlike anything else.  Please do let us know the next time your travels bring you to the Windy City so we can make sure you have another great stay!,Allyson Murphy,Front Office Manager ",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d11687182-r572161043-Hotel_EMC2_Autograph_Collection-Chicago_Illinois.html>
Conrad Chicago,"Dear Racheal S, ,Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago and choosing to write a 5 star review of your stay! We appreciate you taking the time to commend our team for the service they provided to you during your stay and I am glad you found our location to be central to all of the activities that you wished to enjoy in the city. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back soon.,The Conrad lives up to the Hilton Brand.  The room was spacious.  Bathroom had very nice amenities.  In room espresso maker was a true treat.  The employees made the trip extra enjoyable.  You can tell that customer service is a top priority.  So enjoyed staying and look forward to staying again!,Dear 1953James, ,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago. I am glad you had a nice time with us and took your time to recommend our hotel online. We look forward to having you stay with us again. ,I stayed at the Conrad about a week and a half ago for an annual Girls Weekend.  I was excited to see what the new Conrad was like because I was certainly a fan of the old Conrad.  Unfortunately, I doubt I will stay at the new Conrad again.,First, we tried to check in at approximately 2pm, but our room wasn't ready.  That was fine.  We stored our bags with them and then went to Eataly for a late lunch.  We returned at 3:15 and tried to check in again.  Once again, we were told that our room wasn't ready.  When I asked what time the official check-in time was, I was told that it was 3pm.  Finally, our room was ready at almost 4pm.  They did give us a voucher for drinks in the bar, but we truly would rather have been able to check into our room.,Second, the room was not stocked with some of the items that both the website and the front desk had told me earlier in the day were supposed to be available.  In particular, there was only one pair of slippers.  I had called earlier in the day to see if I needed to pack my own, which I was happy to do, but was told that all the room were supplied with them.  When I called the front desk, I was told that the hotel was out of slippers, but that he would call Housekeeping to see if there really were more.  Luckily, Housekeeping did have some.  I felt fortunate, because the snarky attitude from the front desk did not lead me to believe that I would get much help. Also, the bottled water supply was never replenished.  Certainly, there was no turn-down service.,Finally, the worst part was that after waiting well past their own stated check-in time, we were given a room directly across from the elevator bank.  Oh, my god, the noise.  The doors are VERY thin, so both nights we were woken up by the noise of people waiting for elevators.  The hotel did not seem overly crowded, so I have no idea why they gave us this room.  After my stay, I was sent a survey from the hotel.  I suggested that they post a sign at the elevator banks asking guests to be quiet.  The noise from outside, sirens, etc., was not as bad as the noise from the elevators.  ,I wrote about all these things on the Conrad's survey.  I haven't heard a word from them.  In the end, I would stay here only if the rates were very deeply discounted.  The service and attitude is not nearly as good as it was at the former location.  Things just seem disjointed, and no one cares.,Dear Pariskat, ,Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback of your recent stay at the Conrad Chicago. I apologize for the lackluster service you experienced during your stay with us. There is no excuse for the service deficiencies you experienced and I will work with training the team to ensure this does not happen to our future guests. I will attempt to locate your survey through our internal platform so that I can reach out directly. ,Sincerely,,Amilia C,We stayed here for a weekend of shopping and dining, and could not have picked a better location! we were a 1/2 block from the Magnificent Mile shopping district and within walking distance of both restaurants. The hotel itself was wonderful! It was very quiet and very modern. The room was very spacious and my wife was extra happy about the very large bathroom. The huge screen TV was a bonus.,Dear NWTFTOM, ,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and taking time to leave a review of your stay. I am glad you enjoyed our location very much to all of the shopping and restaurants of your choice. It's wonderful that your wife was delighted with the stay as well and we look forward to the opportunity to welcome both of you back to the Conrad Chicago. ,This is my second time staying at this hotel . I got upgraded to a corner suite which was very spacious, consisted of huge Bedroom , living room with a dinning area , one full bathroom and a half bathroom . Modern hotel , clean, great location for a tourist . The restaurant in the 20th floor next to the reception the food was delicious and the service was great the staff are helpful and friendly . I'll stay there again,Dear wedad1, ,Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago. I'm glad you chose to return to our property and were treated with gracious hospitality throughout your entire stay. We thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback and look forward to your return visits. ,We booked through Hilton Honors site unseen the day before arriving as we switched from NYC to Chicago after flights cancelled.  Could not have worked out better.  Great location, wonderful room, excellent people and service.  The bar had an excellent selection of bourbons, the food was very good.  Bartender gave us great recommendations for unique watering holes. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning up after our 12 yr old.  All and all no complaints.  Would highly recommend and hope to stay there again. ,Dear mcirullo, ,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago for your recent stay - I'm glad it worked out in your favor even after canceled flights! We are glad you enjoyed your stay, the room, the bar and the services provided to you by the team members. We look forward to welcome you back when the time allows. ,Sincerely, ,Amilia C",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d10211870-r572328320-Conrad_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html>

The lake and Jackson Park with an awesome view of the Chicago skyline is within easy walking distance.  The Obama Presidential Library is being built just a few blocks away.  We travel with our dog and this hotel is very PET FRIENDLY with just a $75 pet fee per stay.  The rooms have a mini-fridge, are spacious, and well designed.  The breakfast they provide is terrific with a variety of choices.  The parking situation is a little challenging, but there is public parking across the street for $34/ 24 hours.  Valet parking with the hotel is $39/24 hours.  There is a parking garage around the corner that is also $34/24 hours that was easier to do shorter amounts of time.  Oh, and one of the best things, there is a Whole Foods and a Starbucks just around the corner as well.  We enjoyed trying the new places and finding new things to see in the neighborhood.  P.S. Hyde Park has a reputation as being an unsafe neighborhood in Chicago, but there are police on foot and in vehicles all around.

Very comfortable; a bit small.   Was quiet which you don't always get at an in-city hotel.   Parking ... $39/day (Valet with in/out privileges) so add about $6 in tips and it gets pricy.   On a very snowy winter weekend there's not much choice.  there are parking lots and garages very nearby tho (but no in-out privileges of course). Hotel does have a shuttle service to take you to anywhere around UofC so that's nice.   Overall, not cheap, but quiet, comfortable, safe and secure.  Nice folks; remember to TIP THEM.,Dear LindaInEvanston,,Thank you for choosing our hotel for your lodging needs.,We thank you giving a good description of our hotel and amenities.,We hope you will join us for another stay at our property in the near future.,Best Regards, ,Leroy B",<200 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d4551871-r570602156-Hyatt_Place_Chicago_South_University_Medical_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html>
"Thompson Chicago, a Thompson Hotel","Dear kimtrn,,I am so happy that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at the Thompson Chicago! We really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to provide us with an excellent review and I am glad to hear that your experience was memorable. We thank you for praising our service and hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon.,We were in town to celebrate a dear friends 40th birthday. She recommended staying at the Thompson, so we did. From the initial booking, to checkout, our experience was top notch. I had to call and make a slight change to my reservation, and Alex was so very helpful and polite. Upon check in, I got to meet him again, and he was as friendly as could be. Gave us some great information  regarding the hotel and the area, and accommodated an earlier than normal check in for friend of mine. The door staff were so friendly and sweet. The bar staff were great and knowledgeable. The environment was clean and trendy. It was awesome. Our room was exactly what we needed. Plenty of room, very clean, great views, and a great shower! I requested a late checkout and without hesitation the front desk granted it to us. It was a short trip  in and out of the city, but an unforgettable one. I will recommend this hotel to anyone who asks. And i will return next time I visit. ,Dear Lisa W,,I am so happy that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at the Thompson Chicago!

Luxury hotel with friendly, thoughtful and accommodating staff. You will want for nothing at this amazing hotel. Spectacular views, as well!,Dear 483grazynam,,Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us such an outstanding review! I am glad to hear that your overall experience was memorable and that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Thompson Chicago. We look forward to welcoming you back during your next stay with us. ,The room was great. Eclectic. Great vide. Room service was great. Front desk was great. Restaurant for breakfast was great. Staff were very friendly... with one exception.... The service in the bar however when we were in there on Friday afternoon and evening was abysmal.... she was terrible. We were there for several hours and she never once cleaned the table or picked up a single dirty glass and would disappear for literally an hour or so. Several times (4 to be Exact) we either had to go to the hostess for help or go to the bar ourselves to get refills. Then she “reappeared” and asked if we could “cash out” because she was “moving station??”... really unprofessional . We were there for 3 nights... taking this one unprofessional individual out of the equation.... I would recommend it. She was just a bad apple. ,Dear simon w,,I am so happy that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at the Thompson Chicago! We really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to provide us with a great review. I sincerely apologize about the service you encountered while at our bar, and would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention. We would like to thank you for praising our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon.,Stayed for a night before meeting up with family. Room was clean, tastefully decorated, and had a nice view of the city. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful with directions. We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants, but they were crowded and seemed to be a good choice. Would certainly stay again!,Dear TryitAllCA,,We truly appreciate you taking the time to leave us such a great review. It is wonderful to hear that you had a memorable stay with us and we thank you for praising our hotel and service.

From the friendly greeting at the front door, walking through the comfortable and nicely decorated lobby to the courteous, prompt, attentive and impeccably dressed front desk staff, I was immediately impressed. It only got better! The room, though not overly large was more than spacious. There was a good array of snacks and beverages for purchase. The complimentary espresso/coffee was a nice morning treat! The bed was very comfortable and the gorgeous walk in shower was larger than some European hotel rooms! The rooftop Bar is a must do! If not for a drink than at least for the great Chicago views! The adjacent swimming pool would be a nice treat in warmer months. I can not think of one poor thing to say about my stay.  I will definitely return!
